# The Burendo Handbook

Welcome to the  **Burendo Handbook**.  

The Burendo Handbook is a place where we, as Burendoers, document and standardise our ways of working, templates, procedures and tooling.  

If you want to know how we do something within Burendo, it'll likely be within these pages.  Please use the search functionality to help find what you're looking for, or feel free to browse the pages by category on the left!


## What this is not

This is not the staff handbook, as referred to in your employee contracts.  Please use our internal HR tool, contact your line manager or the People team for assistance.

This is not our website. Our website is [here](http://www.burendo.com) and details who are, what we can do for clients and our services we provide. Please do visit it to take a look!
