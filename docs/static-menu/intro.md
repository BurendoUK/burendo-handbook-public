# The Burendo Handbook

Welcome to the  **Burendo Handbook**.  

The Burendo Handbook is a place where we, as Burendoers, document and standardise our ways of working, templates, procedures and tooling.  

If you want to know how we do something within Burendo, it'll likely be within these pages.  Please use the search functionality to help find what you're looking for, or feel free to browse the pages by category on the left!

## How does the Handbook fit in?

The Handbook is an important piece of who we are in Burendo and fits in around other tools and resources we have such as the ones below.

### Burendo.com website

Our website can be found [here](http://www.burendo.com) and details who we are, what we can do for clients and our services we provide. We would encourage you to take a look to learn about our offerings as a company. As our Handbook is focussed on our culture and our values there will be a small amount of crossover as our values are important everywhere however our website is more focussed on our services and offerings as a company compared to the "voice of the Burendoer" view of the Handbook.

### Confluence

Our Confluence is accessible to Burendoers only and focuses on internal policies and quick changing information. It's a tool that will be accessed and used daily within Burendo and it can be found [here](https://burendo.atlassian.net/wiki/home). There is some crossover with the Handbook; for example, we might talk about things on the Handbook as they are important to us and we want to share them with the world, but then have more detail on Confluence for the day-to-day usage of Burendoers.

### SharePoint

We use SharePoint as our main documentation store. We do not use the Handbook for document storage so there is little crossover here.

## A working example

We can use our Practices as an example of what information we put in each place:

* **Handbook** -> A high level overview of our Practices, what they do and how they contribute positively to Burendo and daily life as a Burendoer.

* **Website** -> A note on the Practices and how they fit in with our service offerings and work for/with our clients.

* **Confluence** -> Detailed information on the Practices, including who runs them, when they meet, recordings of sessions, who's who and more.

* **SharePoint** -> Outputs from the Practices, which might be various types of documents.

## Is this the staff handbook?

Nope, this is not the staff handbook - the one referred to in your employee contracts.  Please use our internal People tool, contact your line manager or the People team for assistance.
