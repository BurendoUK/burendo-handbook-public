# Product Design
## Introduction
Product design is about creating usable, valuable, and effective solutions that meet both user needs and business objectives. It blends user experience (UX), user interface (UI), and interaction design to ensure that digital and physical products function well, are easy to use, and create meaningful impact.

At Burendo, we believe great product design:

* **Reduces uncertainty** – By validating concepts early before committing to full-scale development.
* **Prioritises usability and accessibility** – Ensuring that solutions work for all users, regardless of their context or ability.
* **Balances desirability, feasibility, and viability** – Creating products that people want, that can be built effectively, and that align with business goals.
* **Iterates and evolves over time** – Treating design as a continuous process, not a one-time phase.

Product design is not just about visuals—it is about how a product works, how users experience it, and how it fits into a broader service ecosystem.

## Core Principles and Approaches
### 1. User-Centred Design (UCD)
We design products with a deep understanding of real user needs, behaviours, and pain points. Every decision should be informed by research, testing, and feedback.

### 2. Usability and Accessibility First
A well-designed product should be easy to understand and use. It should also be inclusive, ensuring that users with diverse abilities, backgrounds, and needs can interact with it effectively.

### 3. Validation Over Assumptions
We test ideas early and often to reduce risk. Prototypes, usability testing, and real-world feedback are more valuable than opinions or assumptions.

### 4. Simplicity and Clarity
The best products feel effortless to use. We remove unnecessary complexity and focus on clarity, efficiency, and intuitive interactions.

### 5. Systems Thinking
Products do not exist in isolation. We design scalable, reusable, and connected experiences that integrate with the wider service and technology ecosystem.

To apply these principles effectively, we use structured product design techniques, including:

* **Wireframing & Prototyping** – Creating low-to-high-fidelity representations of the product.
* **Usability Testing** – Ensuring real users validate designs before committing to development.
* **Design Systems & Component Libraries** – Standardising reusable UI components for efficiency and consistency.

## Key Practices and Techniques
### 1. Wireframing & Prototyping
Wireframing and prototyping help teams visualise, refine, and test product concepts before development begins.

#### What it helps with:
* Defining and testing layout, interactions, and workflows.
* Gathering feedback on usability before committing to full development.
* Reducing risk by ensuring alignment across stakeholders.

#### How we do it:
* Low-fidelity wireframes for rapid exploration.
* Clickable prototypes to test interactions.
* High-fidelity mockups to refine details before build.

#### Example:
A fintech company might create a clickable prototype of a new loan application process to test whether users can complete it without confusion or frustration.

### 2. Usability Testing
Usability testing helps teams validate whether a product is intuitive and effective by observing real users interacting with it.

#### What it helps with:
* Identifying usability issues before launch.
* Ensuring accessibility for all users.
* Validating whether a product solves the intended problem.

#### How we do it:
* Moderated testing – Users complete tasks while providing real-time feedback.
* Unmoderated testing – Users interact independently while data is captured.
* A/B Testing – Comparing different designs to see which performs better.
#### Example:
An e-commerce company might run usability tests on checkout page designs to identify and remove friction points that lead to abandoned carts.

### 3. Accessibility-First Design
An inclusive product is a better product for everyone. We embed accessibility from the start, ensuring that products are usable by people with disabilities.

#### What it helps with:
* Expanding reach and usability for diverse users.
* Meeting legal and ethical accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).
* Improving clarity and usability for all users.

#### How we do it:
* Ensuring keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
* Using high-contrast designs for visibility.
* Avoiding reliance on colour alone to convey meaning.

#### Example:
A government service might ensure that all forms and interfaces are designed to be fully navigable by screen readers, improving accessibility for users with visual impairments.

### 4. Design Systems & Component Libraries
A design system is a collection of reusable UI components, guidelines, and best practices that ensure consistency across a product.

#### What it helps with:
* Reducing design and development time.
* Ensuring consistency across teams and features.
* Improving scalability and maintainability.

#### How we do it:
* Standardising typography, colour schemes, and UI components.
* Providing clear documentation for designers and engineers.
* Iterating based on new requirements and feedback.

#### Example:
A large SaaS platform might create a design system to ensure that buttons, forms, and layouts remain consistent across multiple applications.

## Bringing It All Together
Product design ensures that we build the right thing in the right way. It is a continuous, iterative process that reduces risk, enhances usability, and ensures alignment between user needs, business goals, and technical feasibility.

* **User-centred and research-driven** – Every decision is informed by real user needs.
* **Focused on simplicity and clarity** – Making products that are easy and enjoyable to use.
* **Iterative and adaptable** – Continuously evolving based on feedback and insights.

At Burendo, we apply product design thinking across all engagements, ensuring that products are not just built, but built right—delivering real value from day one.
