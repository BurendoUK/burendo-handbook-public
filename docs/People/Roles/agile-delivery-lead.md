## Agile Delivery Lead

### Description
Burendo are a Leeds based, Agile consultancy specialising in supporting large and SME organisations improve their Agile adoption and delivery processes. Our clients span multiple industries and countries, and our consultants and coaches use a blend of tools and techniques obtained through their previous practical experience to help teams improve our client’s delivery capability.

We aren’t a big ‘shiny shoes’ consultancy and we don’t really want to be. We believe in the skills of our individuals and the strength of loose networks of specialists to deliver pragmatic solutions to our clients. Chances are you already work in an environment where skilled individuals link up to swarm over challenges… we simply promote it at a larger scale.

As we grow we’re looking to hire an experienced Agile Delivery Lead on a permanent basis to help us both internally and on client sites. You’ll be a key member of our consultancy team and will find yourself supporting delivery teams as they deliver using Agile methodologies.

Our Burendo employees are currently working remotely. In the future we will operate a flexi/blended working model where there will be some requirement to be in the office or on client site. To be considered for a permanent position in our team you must live within a commutable distance from Leeds City Centre or be open to relocation.

### Requirements
These are some of the things we are looking for in candidates... Don’t worry, the checklist is short. If you think you’d be a great fit for us, let us know - we’d much rather have a chat with you to see how you’d fit in!
