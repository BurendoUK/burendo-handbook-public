# Full-Stack Engineer

Great engineers come from many different backgrounds and are specialists in many different areas. At Burendo, we look for people who want to contribute to all areas of the tech stack and get involved in all stages of the software development lifecycle. We are not looking for lots of specific technologies because we believe you can learn these. Instead, we care about your attitude, your desire to learn and your ability to work by yourself and with others.

## Essential behaviours:

These are the most important things to us, we can teach skills, but behaviours are much harder to teach.

- A passion for engineering and a desire to keep learning
- A focus on writing clear, concise code that is easy to maintain
- An ability to be pragmatic when required and avoid unnecessary “gold-plating”
- An understanding that quality is everyone’s responsibility and a strong desire to test your own code
- Comfortable working with others in pairing or mobbing scenarios
- A good communicator who shares our values of openness and respect
- A DevOps mentality – meaning that you don’t want to chuck code over the fence, and you are keen to be involved right through to delivering the code to the customer
- A desire to build up and see others succeed, rather than wanting to be the Hero

## Essential skills

We believe every engineer should have a fundamental understanding of development, infrastructure and testing and therefore you’ll need at least some of these skills to help you pick the role up quickly. It’s not a long list, in no particular order, and like Meatloaf said _"Two out of three ain't bad."_ 

- Experience working within cloud environments, in particular AWS
- A good understanding of and experience working with agile methodologies
- Fundamental coding experience in Python, Java, C# or another widely used language
- Experience in front end development with a language such as JavaScript, TypeScript, ReactJS or AngularJS
- Experience with database technologies of some flavour
- Fundamental understand of infrastructure-as-code with Terraform or an equivalent technology
- Experience working with CI/CD pipelines
- Understanding of and working experience with source control, particularly Git

## Desirable skills

These are the little bit extra, cherry-on-top skills that will help you stand out. Still give us a shout if you haven’t currently got these skills though!

- Experience with no-SQL technologies such as MongoDB
- Experience of building CI/CD pipelines with tools such as GitHub Actions, GitLabCI, Jenkins or Azure DevOps
- Experience working in the public sector and healthcare industry
- Experience working in a technology or consulting company
- Involvement in community building via blogs, online sites, meetups or other means
- Experience working with design professionals in the UX/UI space
