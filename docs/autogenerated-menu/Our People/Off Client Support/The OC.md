# The OC (Off-Client) Team

From time to time colleagues will find that they are between client engagements and not working directly on a brief.  As a result we have processes in place to ensure that people keep engaged, have colleagues to work with, have meaningful work, and have a range of opportunities between those assignments. 

As a consultancy we absolutely need to have a pool of people ready for the new work that comes in, so we can respond to new opportunities, but also we have a continual stream of activity that colleagues can help with when theyâ€™re off client which can contribute to upskilling and making use of their varied experience. 

Colleagues on OC have contributed to new pitches, bid work, corporate outputs, Leeds Digifest, process improvements, CSR Activity, ISO Audit work (supporting bids and frameworks) and business growth activities to name but a few. 

# The Structure

The OC is sponsored by a Senior Leadership Team member to ensure visibility of the efforts at SLT level, overseen by a Client Delivery Lead, and on a week-to-week basis the team choose a co-ordinator/facilitator for their ceremonies as part of being a representative Agile self-organising team. 

OC Team members can also identify their own initiatives, complete training plans (funded by their training budget) and consolidate activities towards their Career Growth Reviews.
