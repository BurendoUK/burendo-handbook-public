# Test Consultant

At Burendo, we believe testing is the responsibility of everyone, but we need Senior Test Engineers to help guide our clients in how to ensure quality in a modern, agile environment. We need Testers who can not only do but, importantly, can advocate and evangelise for testing in the right way.

As a Senior Test Engineer at Burendo, you will work with clients to help guide their testing strategy and help them focus on quality. You may be writing automated checks, participating or running 3 Amigos sessions, getting involved with tool selection and pipelines or other activities but your focus is on being an advocate for testing in the right way.

## Essential behaviours

These are the things we value most at Burendo, we can teach skills, but our behaviours forge the culture we strive for.

- A systematic and questioning mind, rather than taking things at face value
- Able to be pragmatic when needed
- A complete focus on quality at all levels in the software development life cycle
- A great communicator who can have conversations with both technical and non-technical people
- A test-first mindset, rather than sticking rigidly to specific methodologies
- A focus on testing early and testing often
- An understanding of the need to push testing close to the code and a strong desire to create quick feedback cycles

## Essential skills

We believe every engineer should have a fundamental understanding of development, infrastructure and testing and therefore you’ll need at least some of these skills to help you pick the role up quickly. It’s not a long list, in no particular order, and like Meatloaf said _"Two out of three ain't bad."_  Burendo are invested in the growth of our consultants, and provide a healthy self development budget you can use to grow in the areas mentioned below, or any other of your choosing!

At least one of:
- An understanding of the testing pyramid
- An understanding in the use of automation in the appropriate places
- Experience of API testing using tools such as Postman or JMeter
- Exposure to CI/CD pipelines and experience of continuous testing
- An understanding of and ability to influence non-functional requirements
- Experience creating test strategies and collaborating with people to achieve this

Any of:
- An understanding of behavioural driven development (BDD) and its benefits and drawbacks
- Ability to understand and debug code using IDEs such as Visual Studio or IntelliJ
- Experience of source code management
- A thorough understanding of being a tester in an agile environment
- Experience working within cloud environments, in particular AWS

## Desirable skills

These are the little bit extra, cherry-on-top skills that will help you stand out. Still give us a shout if you haven’t currently got these skills though!

- Experience working with both SQL and no-SQL databases
- Experience of code analysis tools such as Checkmarx, X-Ray or Sonarqube
- Experience of building CI/CD pipelines with tools such as GitHub Actions, GitLabCI, Jenkins or Azure DevOps
- Experience working with performance test tools such as Locust or JMeter
- Working knowledge of infrastructure-as-code technologies such as Terraform
- Experience working with UI automation tools such as Selenium or Cypress
- Working knowledge of unit testing tools for scripting languages such as MochaJS or Jest
- An ability to write automation in at least one of Python, JavaScript, Java or C#
- Understanding of test-driven development (TDD) and when to use it
