# Roles Introduction

Everyone who is a Burendo consultant is both a consultant and a practitioner. We all have practitioner skills in one or more areas and we use these skills to perform different roles for our clients. However, we are also consultants. There are many things that go in to making up a consultant and we wear many hats every day, from people manager, to coach, to account lead. To help our people understand what is needed from each of these roles, we sometimes create role profiles that aid the understanding of what is needed. These role profiles can be viewed from the "Role Profiles" section in the menu.

## Career Growth

We have a detailed career growth framework which helps our Burendoers to see where they can do with their career at Burendo and how they can progress. It allows for individuality within people's day-to-day jobs and their passions while ensuring that we are fairly assessing performance for people. Having everyone as a consultant but with many hats that people can wear allows us to do this.
