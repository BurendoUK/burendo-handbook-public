## Introduction

Burendo colleagues who are off or between client engagements are encouraged to take the lead with achieving our Missions; from improving how and where we work, to identifying and implementing value-add opportunities, and everything in between. The O.C. aims to provide the structure and support to do this in a collaborative community setting.
