# Community Support

The wider Burendo community is an important part of the overall Burendoer support network. There are two main areas where Burendoers can seek out support from the community.

## Practices

Within Burendo, we have Practices who are there to build communities around shared skills and services. Each Practice has one or more Practice Leads who have the following responsibilities when it comes to People Support within their Practice:

- Advise on personal development and help guide on how to deliver great services
- Support Burendoers where they need practitioner advice and help with difficult scenarios on client

## Communities of Interest

Burendo encourages communities of interest, which are a group of people who have a shared interest finding a space to help each other. This can be anything from a CoI on a specific job (i.e. BA) or skillset (i.e. Value Stream Mapping) or just something people are interested in (i.e. home improvement).

This feeds in to the support network by providing the following:

- Support Burendoers around specific areas of interest with advice from a wider Burendo community
- Provide a place to discuss topics with individuals with similar interests
