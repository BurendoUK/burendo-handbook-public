# Account Support

A Burendoer's account is the most regular support network they will have at Burendo as it is their day-to-day contact when they are working on a client.

The whole account is a support network but there are also specific responsibilities within Burendo on the account side.

##Â Account Lead

An account lead has delivery accountability for the workstreams they lead.

Account Lead is a senior hat people wear and we incentivise it by it helping Burendoers towards your career growth at Burendo by taking on extra responsibilities (along with the intrinsic motivation some people have for responsibilities like this).

### Responsibilities

The following things are examples of what an Account Lead does:

- Account stakeholder management at an operational level
- Main point of contact for day-to-day operational activity of the account
- Responsible for account level commercials, including SoWs
- Upward reporting to the Head of Delivery for the tribe (inc maintaining Account Status sheet)
- Running regular operational account reviews
- Point of escalation for performance and sickness issues
- Onboard and offboard account members and maintenance of account information on Confluence
- Champion progression and rotation in team planning
- Facilitate account socials
- Accountable for operational communications to the business
- Responsible for tracking delivery

## Team Champion

Team champions have accountability for the day-to-day pastoral care for one or more people on their account. Whereas [People Advocates](people-support.md/#people-advocate) will be more long term and concentrating on a Burendoer's growth overall, the Team Champion is purely focused on a Burendoer within the account and will therefore change when that Burendoer changes account.

Team Champion is a hat people wear and we incentivise it by it helping Burendoers towards your career growth at Burendo by taking on extra responsibilities (along with the intrinsic motivation some people have for responsibilities like this).
 

### Responsibilities

The following things are examples of what a Team Champion does:

- Managing holidays, sickness, other absence, timesheets and other admin for people on the account
- Regular 121s with account members
- Providing feedback for account members
- Managing performance and disciplinary issues
- Onboard and offboard members to the tribe
- Conduct probation reviews
