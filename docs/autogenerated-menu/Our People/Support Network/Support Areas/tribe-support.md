# Tribe Support

At Burendo, we work within a Tribe structure to organise our consultant Burendoers and our Clients and Accounts. A tribe is a key support mechanism for Burendoers as support can be sought from any member of the tribe, but there are also two key roles in each tribe involved in the support network.

## Head of Delivery

Each tribe has a Head of Delivery (HoD). These are full time jobs rather than hats people wear and are quite senior within the organisation. HoDs therefore have a high-level remit of people responsibilities, which includes:

- Decision maker on flexible working requests
- Decision maker on leave entitlement within policy guidelines
- Manage personal development budgets for individuals
- Facilitate tribe socials

## Tribe Curator

Each tribe has one or more curators who are there to help drive forwards the tribe and improve the working lives of everyone in it.

Tribe Curator is a hat people wear and we incentivise it by it helping Burendoers towards your career growth at Burendo by taking on extra responsibilities (along with the intrinsic motivation some people have for responsibilities like this).

### Responsibilities

The following things are examples of what a Tribe Curator does:

- Leading on and running tribal events
- Bring ideas to the table and drive innovation in the tribe
- Sponsoring work on the tribe board
- Driving forward continuous improvement initiatives
- Being a point of contact for tribe members, especially in absence of HoD
- Helping roll out tribe-wide initiatives from HoD / People Partner
