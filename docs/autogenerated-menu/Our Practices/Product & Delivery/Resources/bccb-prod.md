## Books

- **The Lean Start-Up, Eric Ries**  

  “The Lean Startup provides a scientific approach to creating and managing startups and get a desired product to customers' hands faster. The Lean Startup method teaches you how to drive a startup-how to steer, when to turn, and when to persevere-and grow a business with maximum acceleration. It is a principled approach to new product development.”  

  Even if you aren’t in a start-up or working with a greenfield product, you should use this method and philosophy to drive up innovation of your product at pace: build - measure - learn!

- **Lean UX, Jeff Gothelf**  

  “The book laid the groundwork for different ways that companies handle their UX process, and introduced a system that emphasizes the following:  
  
  - *Removing waste.* The system seeks to cut through common, time-consuming tactics like frequent documentation by creating minimal viable products that drive learning quickly.  

  - *Constant collaboration.* Lean UX brings together teams from “designers, developers, product managers, quality assurance engineers, marketers, and others” through frequent contact and communication (From Lean UX).  

  - *More experimentation.* Designers leverage rapid experimentation with their designs to uncover more grounded information and lessons on their products.”  

  Lean UX is not purely for designers, its a philosophy and method that is useful across professions involved in the delivery of products

- **Inspired: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love, Marty Cagan**  

  “How do today’s most successful tech companies―Amazon, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Tesla―design, develop, and deploy the products that have earned the love of literally billions of people around the world? Perhaps surprisingly, they do it very differently than most tech companies. In INSPIRED, technology product management thought leader Marty Cagan provides readers with a master class in how to structure and staff a vibrant and successful product organization, and how to discover and deliver technology products that your customers will love―and that will work for your business.”

- **Product Leadership: How Top Product Managers Launch Awesome Products and Build Successful Teams, Richard Banfield, Martin Eriksson, Nate Walkingshaw**  

  “In today's lightning-fast technology world, good product management is critical to maintaining a competitive advantage. Yet, managing human beings and navigating complex product roadmaps is no easy task, and it's rare to find a product leader who can steward a digital product from concept to launch without a couple of major hiccups. Why do some product leaders succeed while others don't?”

- **The Phoenix Project, Gene Kim**

  Easy to read, fictional style covering the following themes:

  The 4 Types of Work (business projects, internal projects, changes and unplanned work)

  - Work in Process (WIP)

  - Kanban

  - “10 Deployments per Day”

  - Theory of Constraints

  - The 3 Ways (continuous delivery improvement, fast feedback to pre-empt failures, and rapid experimentation)

  Though more in the DevOps / Delivery space, really useful take on maximising productivity that is relevant across professional roles.

- **Play Bigger, Al Ramadan**  

  “Today's most exciting companies create categories. They sell us different — not just better. They solve a problem we didn't even know we had. This is the real genius of Amazon, Salesforce, Uber, IKEA and others. They are category kings.

  You can't build a legendary new company without first building a substantial new category in the marketplace. To play bigger, you have to position yourself as the leader in that category — because you're different — and then convince everyone that category is going to be a very big deal. You have to:

  - *Develop a point of view* — which explains why you exist and what you will do for the world.

  - *Condition the market* — help consumers understand which problem you solve for them.

  - *Design an ecosystem* — a community of supporters, partners, colleagues, evangelists.

  - *Fire up a lightning strike* — do something to shock the market and get attention.

  - *Establish yourself and then keep expanding your category* — build on your position and move outward and upward.”

  Though more in the start-up / scale-up space, really useful perspective around thinking about and overall product purpose - definition, understanding, roll-out, measurement and communication

- **Team Topologies, Mathew Skelton**

  “Effective software teams are essential for any organization to deliver value continuously and sustainably. But how do you build the best team organization for your specific goals, culture, and needs?

  Team Topologies is a practical, step-by-step, adaptive model for organizational design and team interaction based on four fundamental team types and three team interaction patterns.
