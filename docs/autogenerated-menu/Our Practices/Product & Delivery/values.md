# Our Values

As a community, we’ve agreed that we will strive for these things:

## No egos please

We want show up for ourselves and our community and operate as a team.  This is not a place for ‘rock stars’ or people with bad attitudes.

## Champion each other

We’re proud to be a team and want to continue to foster our safe space, appreciating each other for our different skills and experiences.

## Be better than yesterday

We are all unfinished and continually growing and improving.  We won’t beat ourselves up about things that didn’t work out, we’ll learn from them and be better than yesterday.

## Sorry, no

We’ll stick to our principles and be firm on things that don’t feel right or mess with our integrity.

## Don’t be a d*ck

Be honest, humble, reflective and have a growth mindset
