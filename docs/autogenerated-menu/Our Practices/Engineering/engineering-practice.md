# The Engineering Practice

This section contains all the details on the Engineering Practice, links to the tools, ways of working and processes we have created and actively consume/use.

## Practice Details

### Who we are  

We are Burendoers with a common interest in engineering; whether through practical application, theory, or an interest in how engineering works with other practices within the business.

### Practice Goals  

- Develop Burendo as a recognised brand of choice for engineering consultancy.
- Become experts in our chosen areas, and display this expertise through certification, blogs, workshops, presentations etc.
- Create, apply and uphold standardised ways of working, that both benefit the business and clients alike.
- Embody our practice values of being _Open_ and _Transparent_ whilst creating _Repeatable_ and _Observable_ consumables.
- Create and champion open-source consumables, that can be used both internally, on client, and out in the open.

### Practice Values

- Open
- Transparent
- Repeatable
- Observable

### Regular Meetings  

All our meetings are captured in the practice calendar. As a Burendoer, you can join the calendar, or find links to the meetings following the bookmarked links from the `#practice-engineering` channel on Slack.

- Monthly meetup.
  - Held on the 3rd Thursday of every month at 1500.
  - Open forum format, with space for an agenda if required
  - We all attend in person where possible


### Slack

The `#practice-engineering` channel on Slack is our main platform for communication, outside of any face to face meetings.  This will be the place to share and get the latest information or ask questions and get the most prompt response.

### Work backlog 

- Our work is traditionally captured and managed in tickets.  
- Through our workload management tool, we manage our backlog of work, as well as current work in flight.  
- We tend to work in a Kanban style, as most work is undertaken ad-hoc.  Short time boxes, such as sprints, would not suit our ability to deliver.

### Blogs

Our engineering blogs can be found [here](/blog/tags/engineering/).
