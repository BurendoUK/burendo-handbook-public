# Engineering Manifesto

As Burendo Engineers, we should always consider the 4 tenets of Burendo Consultancy when operating internally, or externally with a client:

* Open
* Transparent
* Repeatable
* Observable

These tenets ensure we are applying the Burendo values and they guarantee we always deliver the same quality of work in all things by approaching, creating and delivering engineering work with a unified mindset.  This also means we can have high confidence in picking up unfamiliar work, creating new work, onboarding to new teams, and handing over work to others.

While these tenets are not written in stone, or lend themselves to any specific technology, they are the guidelines that all work should follow.

## Open

_Openness removes specific barriers to access, and provides permissions to participate, and clearly defines how we secure our work._

### Why

  * Enable work to be progressed by all.
  * Clear goals/targets that everyone can understand and deliver.
  * Inclusive direction where everyone has influence..
  * Empower choice through collaboration.
  * Ensure trust and safety how we operate.

### How

  * Encourage challenging closed and distant decision making.
  * Providing access to information, and permission to participate.
  * Open source as much as responsibly possible.
  * Visualise all goals and work items, and necessary constraints.
  * Hold regular forums to engage everyone.

## Transparent

_Transparency promotes open and honest communication in as close to real-time as possible. It ensures an open forum where everyone has visibility and the ability to influence decisions._

### Why

  * Promotes accountability
  * No surprises
  * Collaboration
  * Big picture thinking
  * Reduced risk

### How

  * All things are developed, discussed, tracked and documented openly.
  * Peer reviewed code with clear standards and guidelines.
  * Clear definition of done, including considerations for quality and security.
  * Openly share feedback, successes and lessons learned.
  

## Repeatable

_Repeatable processes make efficient use of components that have proved to be successful in the past and reduce unnecessary variations that can tie up time, effort, budget or introduce unintended risks._

### Why

  * Trust in what we create.
  * Flexibility to handle many use cases.
  * Quickly establish trust with external, or neighbouring teams.
  * High confidence in testing.

### How

  * Everything As Code, using sensible, proven defaults.
  * Small transferable components that are trusted and verified.
  * Automation in processes, testing and validation using CI/CD.
  * Clear documentation and consistent ways of working.

## Observable

_Use data and tooling to observe the state and behaviour of a system before, during and after development to learn more about its patterns of strengths and weakness._

### Why

  * Fully understand any system at all times.
  * Monitoring only after release is reactive and limits understanding.
  * Proactively discover patterns of weakness and strength.
  * Establish clear ownership and response patterns.

### How
  * High value event driven metrics and meaningful logging.
  * Actionable  checks and alerts.
  * Clear and fast feedback loops.
  * Maintain practical runbooks for predictable management of systems, including handling unexpected events.
