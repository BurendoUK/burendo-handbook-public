# Engineering Manifesto

As Burendo Engineers, we should always consider the 4 tenets of Burendo Consultancy when operating internally, or externally with a client:

* Open
* Transparent
* Repeatable
* Observable

These tenets ensure we are applying the Burendo values and they guarantee we always deliver the same quality of work in all things by approaching, creating and delivering engineering work with a unified mindset.  This also means we can have high confidence in picking up unfamiliar work, creating new work, onboarding to new teams, and handing over work to others.

While these tenets are not written in stone, or lend themselves to any specific technology, they are the guidelines that all work should follow.

## Open

_Openness removes specific barriers to access, and provides permissions to participate._

### Why

  * Enable work to be progressed by all.
  * Clear goals/targets that everyone can understand and deliver.
  * Inclusive direction where everyone has influence..
  * Empower choice through collaboration.

### How

  * Encourage challenging closed and distant decision making.
  * Providing access to information, and permission to participate.
  * Open source as much as possible.
  * Visualise all goals and work items.
  * Hold regular forums to engage people.

## Transparent

_Transparency promotes open and honest communication in as close to real-time as possible. It ensures an open forum where everyone is given total access, and the ability to influence decisions at any time._

### Why

  * Promotes accountability
  * No surprises
  * Collaboration
  * Big picture thinking
  * Reduced risk

### How

  * All things are developed, discussed and tracked.
  * Peer reviewed code.
  * Clear definition of done.
  * Feedback to the business with stories of success and failure.
  

## Repeatable

_Repeatable processes make efficient use of components that have proved to be successful in the past and reduce unnecessary variations that can tie up time, effort and budget._

### Why

  * Trust in what we create.
  * Flexibility to handle many use cases.
  * Quickly establish trust with external, or neighbouring teams.
  * High confidence in testing.

### How

  * Everything As Code.
  * Our way.
  * Small transferable components.
  * CI/CD.

## Observable

_Use data and tooling to observe the state and behaviour of a system before, during and after development to learn more about its patterns of weakness._

### Why

  * To understand any system as much as possible at all times.
  * Monitoring only after release only works when something fails.
  * Discover patterns of weakness/strength.
  * Establish ownership.

### How
  * High value event driven metrics.
  * Quality Logging that means something when read back.
  * Many actionable active checks and alerts.
  * High quality, fast feedback loops.
  * Maintaining a run book for stability and predictability in production systems.
