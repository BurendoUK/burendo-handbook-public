# AWS Beginners Labs
We want to encourage, educate and engage with budding engineers - one way to do this is to run beginners labs.
These sessions aren't limited just for beginners - we can use the pre-made sessions to educate and up skill our own and client engineers.

Labs by their nature should be hands on, they are less about talking theoretically about how something can be done or demonstrating something that was created.
They are designed to educate people on a small section of knowledge at a time. They should be self contained and completing any should create a finished product - therefore not requiring a chain of labs to achieve something.

## Labs we've created
All the labs we've created for AWS are available on this handbook and in the [burendo-aws-labs](https://github.com/BurendoUK/burendo-aws-labs) repo.

Available labs:
- [WordPress via AWS Console](https://github.com/BurendoUK/burendo-aws-labs/tree/main/Labs/wordpress-via-console)
- [WordPress via Infrastructure as Code](https://github.com/BurendoUK/burendo-aws-labs/tree/main/Labs/wordpress-via-iac/)

## Getting started
All labs come with an instruction set that should be all encompassing. Any issues, please raise via GitHub issue feature.

##Â Learnings along the way
Some learnings came from our first beginners lab. We should look to improve the experience and value ahead of the next one.
