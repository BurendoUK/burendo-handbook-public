# Practices Introduction

Our company has various core Communities of Practice (CoPs), which are groups of people sharing common interests or knowledge domain. They meet regularly to learn from one another, share good practices, and collaborate on projects. CoPs shape our Products and Services by defining and refining our Service Catalogue and the skills needed to deliver them, ensuring they meet customer requirements whilst fostering innovation and growth as new tools & techniques emerge.

Anyone at Burendo can be a member of any Practice, they are open to all.  At Burendo, we're Consultants first, allowing us to cover a wide range of Skills and Services.

## Practice Leads

Each Practice is led by a group of Practice Leads, who specialise in a group of Skills, Tools, Products & Services.  The Practice Leads ensure that the CoP offers best value to each member, as well as Burendo.
