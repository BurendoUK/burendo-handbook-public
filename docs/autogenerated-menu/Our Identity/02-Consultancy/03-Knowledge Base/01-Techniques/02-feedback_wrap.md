# Feedback Wrap

## Introduction  
The **Feedback Wrap** is a structured approach for constructing helpful, effective feedback. Taken from an Agile Leadership approach called **Management 3.0**, it is a technique that maximises the chance of feedback having the best outcome for both the person giving the feedback and the person receiving it. In short, the **Feedback Wrap** helps you give better feedback.  


## When Should I Use the Feedback Wrap?  
The Feedback Wrap can be used in almost any situation where you need to **set or manage expectations** or share how someone’s actions have impacted you.  

Expectation management is particularly crucial in **newly formed relationships**. If people don’t know what your expectations are for their performance or behaviour, and you never let them know when they don’t meet or exceed those expectations, they never get a chance to course correct.

## How Does the Feedback Wrap Work?  
Feedback should have **real value for the recipient** and achieve the **intended aim of the person giving the feedback**. The Feedback Wrap technique prompts you to carefully consider **what you hope to achieve** and **how you should deliver it** so that it lands effectively.  

The Feedback Wrap follows **five key steps**:

### 1. Describe Your Context  
Start by offering **background information** to set the scene. Providing context increases the other person's understanding and appreciation of your situation.  

**Example:**  
*"During the customer showcase today, when you were demonstrating the new product features…"*  

### 2. List Your Observations  
Describe **specific behaviours and actions** rather than making general statements. Keep the feedback focused on **what was done** rather than assumptions about intent.  

**Example:**  
*"I noticed you said, ‘It works well when I run it, I can’t be held responsible for the testers missing things and the production environments being inconsistent…’"*  

### 3. Express Your Feelings  
Describe how their actions made you **feel**. This makes the feedback more powerful and helps the recipient reflect on the **effect of their actions** on others.  

**Example:**  
*"This made me feel very uncomfortable on behalf of the team, and I’m worried that it makes us look unprofessional and defensive in front of our customers."*  

### 4. Explain the Value  
Explain **why it matters** and **what’s important** to you. This part of the feedback helps the recipient understand your perspective.  

**Example:**  
*"We work as a team, in collaboration with each other and our customers, to solve problems and deliver value together. We always want others to see that. I don’t think the way you expressed yourself would create that impression."*  

### 5. Offer Some Suggestions  
Provide the recipient with **practical suggestions** to help them improve, rather than simply pointing out the issue. Alternatively, **ask them a question** to prompt their own reflection.  

**Example:**  
*"I’ll happily help you to work on your communication techniques when dealing with senior stakeholders. I can share a way of phrasing things that gets your point across without upsetting people. As a team, we can look at how we improve our ways of working so that development and testing are more joined up and we don’t miss things in the future."*  


## How Should I Use the Feedback Wrap?  
One of the biggest benefits of the **Feedback Wrap** is that it helps you take the time to **organise your thoughts** before delivering feedback. Following all the steps ensures that you deliver **meaningful and well-rounded** feedback.  

If you’re delivering feedback **in person** (which is recommended), don’t read from a script. Use your notes to **structure a two-way conversation**, listening to what the other person is saying.  

If you must deliver feedback **in written form**, follow the structure subtly and **review your language carefully** to ensure clarity. Written feedback can be easily misinterpreted, so where possible, ask a trusted peer to review it before sending.  

## Why is Feedback Important?  
Feedback is essential for **helping people grow and develop**. It helps us learn and reflect on things we may not have realised we were doing.  

Creating good, constructive feedback is difficult, and many people struggle with both **giving** and **receiving** it. By **focusing on effective feedback**, we can build a culture where honest feedback is shared frequently and helps individuals, teams, and organisations improve.  


## What Makes Good Feedback?  
There is a difference between **appreciation** and **feedback**, and everyone needs both.  

- **Appreciation** recognises positive contributions. You **cannot overdo appreciation**—nobody ever performed worse because they were appreciated!  
- **Feedback**, however, should be **specific and actionable**.  

For feedback to be effective, it needs to be something the receiver can **act upon**. Anything we can do to make feedback **more specific and useful** increases the chances of it being well received.  

### Characteristics of Good Feedback  

#### **1. Specific**  
The more **specific** the feedback, the easier it is to **understand and act upon**.  

**Example:**  
- *"You’re lazy."* (Unhelpful and vague)  
- *"I expect someone of your seniority to be more proactive. If nobody assigns you a task, check the backlog and take the next highest-priority item. If you’re stuck, ask for help."* (Actionable and clear)  

#### **2. Timely**  
Feedback should be given **as soon as possible** after an event while being mindful of the time and place.  

#### **3. Frequent**  
Feedback should be a **continuous process**, not a one-off event. A culture of **regular feedback** helps people improve in real time rather than only during annual reviews.  

#### **4. Given to Help the Person Grow**  
Ask yourself:  
- *Am I giving this feedback to help them improve?*  
- *Or am I just venting frustration?*  

If it’s the latter, reconsider. Feedback should always be **constructive**.  

#### **5. Focused on Behaviour, Not the Person**  
Feedback should focus on **actions** rather than personal attributes.  

**Example:**  
- *"You’re always late to stand-up. You’re lazy!"* (Personal and unhelpful)  
- *"I’ve noticed you’ve arrived late to stand-up all this week. If everyone isn’t there, we miss important information. Is there anything I can do to help make it easier for you to be on time?"* (Supportive and actionable)  

#### **6. Ask First**  
Before giving feedback, **ask the recipient if they’re open to it**. This helps them get into the right mindset.  

**Example:** *"Would you be open to some feedback?"*  

#### **7. Taken as a Gift**  
Receiving feedback can be difficult, but try to **see it as a gift**.  

Even if the feedback is **not perfectly delivered**, the fact that someone took the time to share it means they **care about your growth**. Even if you don’t fully agree with it, there may be something valuable in it.  

If the feedback was genuinely meant to help, **embrace it**. If it was simply venting, **let it go** and move on.
