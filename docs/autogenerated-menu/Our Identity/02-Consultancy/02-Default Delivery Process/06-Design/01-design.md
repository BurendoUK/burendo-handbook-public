# Design: Shaping Effective Solutions and Organisations
Design is how we **explore, refine, and define** solutions before committing to delivery. It helps reduce uncertainty, align teams, and ensure that what we build meets real user and business needs.

Design is not just about aesthetics or documentation, it is a problem-solving process that applies across **services, products, technology, and even organisations.**

* **In service design,** we map out how people interact with a system, ensuring every touchpoint creates a smooth and effective experience.
* **In product design,** we create and test ideas to ensure we are building something that users want, understand, and can easily use.
* **In technology design,** we explore architecture, technical feasibility, and system interactions to create scalable and maintainable solutions.
* **In organisation design,** we help businesses evolve by shaping the structures, teams, and ways of working that enable new products and services to succeed.

Effective design means solving the right problems—not just creating a great product or service, but ensuring it can be successfully adopted. When new technologies, products, or services are introduced, they often require **new ways of working, new team structures, and new operational models.** We work with our customers to define and implement these changes, helping their organisations adapt and thrive.

Design should be collaborative and iterative. It is not a one-time phase but an ongoing activity that helps teams make informed decisions, adapt to new insights, and create solutions that truly work—not just in theory, but in practice.
