# Organisation Design
## Introduction
Organisation design ensures that **teams, structures, and ways of working** are **aligned to deliver business objectives effectively**. It is about **creating the right environment for success** and ensuring that **people, processes, and technology work together** in a way that is **scalable, adaptable, and sustainable.**

At Burendo, we see organisation design as a critical enabler for:

* **Scaling and sustaining great products and services** – Ensuring teams are structured for long-term success.
* **Enabling agility and adaptability** – Helping organisations evolve as their needs and challenges change.
* **Bridging strategy and execution** – Making sure operating models align with business goals.
* **Improving collaboration and effectiveness** – Removing bottlenecks, silos, and inefficiencies.

Organisation design is not just about org charts or processes—it is about creating an environment where teams can deliver great outcomes.

## Core Principles and Approaches
### 1. Structure Should Follow Strategy
Organisations should be designed around the work that needs to be done, rather than forcing teams into rigid structures.

### 2. Balance Stability with Adaptability
Teams and structures should be scalable and repeatable but also flexible enough to evolve as business needs change.

### 3. Minimise Silos, Maximise Collaboration
Strong organisation design ensures that teams work together effectively, reducing handoffs, dependencies, and inefficiencies.

### 4. Empower Teams with Clear Accountability
Great organisations balance autonomy and alignment, giving teams the freedom to make decisions while ensuring they are accountable for results.

### 5. Design for Learning and Growth
An effective organisation is one that continuously improves, enabling people to develop and adapt as challenges evolve.

To apply these principles effectively, we use structured organisation design techniques, including:

* **Org Structure Mapping** – Understanding how teams, roles, and functions fit together.
* **Capability Assessments** – Identifying strengths, gaps, and opportunities for improvement.
* **Ways of Working Frameworks**  – Defining how teams collaborate and deliver.

## Key Practices and Techniques
### 1. Org Structure Mapping
Org structure mapping ensures that teams and roles are aligned with business priorities and delivery needs.

#### What it helps with:
* Clarifying roles and responsibilities.
* Identifying bottlenecks, overlaps, or inefficiencies.
* Ensuring teams are structured for collaboration and accountability.

#### How we do it:
* **Identify key value streams** – How does work flow across the organisation?
* **Define team structures** – Ensuring the right balance of specialists and generalists.
* **Ensure cross-functional alignment** – Teams should be empowered to deliver end-to-end value.

#### Example:
A global fintech company struggling with slow decision-making might move from functional silos to cross-functional teams, reducing dependencies and increasing speed to market.

### 2. Capability Assessments
Capability assessments help organisations understand what skills, knowledge, and competencies they need to succeed.

### What it helps with:
* Identifying skill gaps that impact delivery effectiveness.
* Informing hiring, training, and team development strategies.
* Ensuring teams have the right mix of technical, operational, and strategic expertise.

#### How we do it:
* **Assess current capabilities** – What skills and expertise exist today?
* **Identify gaps and future needs** – What capabilities will be critical in the next 1-3 years?
* **Develop a roadmap** – How do we grow the right capabilities through hiring, training, or restructuring?

#### Example:
A scaling SaaS company may find that their engineering teams lack product management skills, leading to a capability gap in translating customer needs into product improvements.

### 3. Ways of Working Frameworks
Defining how teams collaborate, make decisions, and deliver work ensures that processes are effective without being restrictive.

#### What it helps with:
* Ensuring teams work efficiently and consistently without unnecessary bureaucracy.
* Defining decision-making processes and escalation paths.
* Aligning teams on common principles and best practices.

#### How we do it:
* **Define key workflows** – How do teams work together across functions?
* **Clarify governance without stifling agility**  – Ensuring the right level of oversight.
* **Ensure adaptability** – Frameworks should evolve based on what works best for teams.

#### Example:
A digital bank struggling with inconsistent delivery approaches might introduce a lightweight governance model, ensuring teams operate independently while staying aligned on key business goals.

## Bringing It All Together
Organisation design ensures that businesses are structured for long-term success, adaptability, and effectiveness. It is about:

* **Creating structures that support strategy** – Aligning teams to deliver the most value.
* **Enabling agility and efficiency** – Ensuring organisations can adapt without chaos.
* **Removing friction and improving collaboration** – Reducing handoffs, inefficiencies, and silos.
* **Building teams that continuously improve** – Developing capabilities that evolve with business needs.

At Burendo, we apply organisation **design thinking across all engagements**, ensuring that businesses are **structured to scale, adapt, and succeed in delivering great products and services.**
