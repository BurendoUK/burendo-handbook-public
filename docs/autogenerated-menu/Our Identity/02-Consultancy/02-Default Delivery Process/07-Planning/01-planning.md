# Planning
## Introduction
Planning is about setting direction, aligning teams, and ensuring successful execution. It provides a shared understanding of what needs to be done, why, and when, while maintaining the flexibility to adapt as new insights emerge.

At Burendo, we view planning as an ongoing process, not a one-time event. Effective planning ensures that:

* Teams are aligned on business goals, technical feasibility, and delivery priorities.
* Work is structured for incremental delivery, reducing risk and increasing feedback loops.
* Roadmaps remain flexible, balancing predictability with adaptability.

Planning happens at multiple levels:

1. **Strategic Planning** – High-level vision and long-term direction.
2. **Delivery Roadmaps** – Short-to-medium-term prioritisation and sequencing of work.
3. **Iteration Planning** – Tactical planning of upcoming work within a sprint or delivery cycle.
   
#### Key Inputs:
* High-level product, service, and technical vision
* Customer goals and business priorities
* Insights from previous validation and discovery

#### Key Outputs:
* A clear roadmap of prioritised epics or workstreams
* Refined backlog items ready for implementation
* Identified risks, dependencies, and mitigation strategies

## Core Principles of Planning
### 1. Plan with Purpose
Every planning activity should have a clear outcome, whether it’s defining high-level direction, sequencing work, or adjusting priorities.

### 2. Balance Structure and Flexibility
Plans should provide enough structure to give clarity but remain adaptable to change as delivery progresses.

### 3. Focus on Delivering Value Early
We prioritise work that provides the most business value, de-risks delivery, and accelerates learning.

### 4. Make Risks and Uncertainty Visible
Uncertainty is inevitable—surfacing risks early and iterating on the plan helps manage complexity effectively.

### 5. Keep it Lightweight and Practical
We avoid unnecessary overheads—simple, visual planning tools work best for communication and collaboration.

## Key Planning Practices and Techniques
### 1. Strategic Planning: Setting the Direction
Strategic planning provides the big-picture view of where we’re going and why.

#### What it helps with:
* Aligning delivery with customer and business priorities.
* Identifying key themes, initiatives, and long-term goals.
* Providing clarity without rigidity—allowing teams to pivot as needed.

#### How we do it:
* **Define high-level goals** – What must be achieved in the next 6-12 months?
* **Identify key constraints and enablers** – What might impact delivery (e.g., dependencies, resourcing, technical feasibility)?
* **Set priorities based on value, risk, and feasibility.**
  
#### Example:
A public sector organisation planning a data modernisation initiative may outline a 12-month roadmap with quarterly milestones, ensuring alignment with policy and funding cycles while remaining flexible to changes in government priorities.

### 2. Delivery Roadmaps: Prioritising and Sequencing Work
A roadmap is a high-level, visual plan that aligns workstreams and provides clarity on what will be delivered over the next 3–6 months.

#### What it helps with:
* Providing a shared view of priorities across teams and stakeholders.
* Helping teams sequence work to maximise value and reduce dependencies.
* Ensuring the plan is realistic and adaptable.

#### How we do it:
* **Break down work into epics** – Define deliverable chunks of value.
* **Use a lightweight roadmap tool** – Miro, Jira, a simple Kanban board or even old school physical index cards.
* **Use time horizons rather than fixed dates** – Near-term (next 2 iterations), mid-term (next quarter), long-term (beyond 6 months).
* **Apply T-shirt sizing to epics** – XS to XL, with uncertainty levels noted.
* **Limit work in progress** – Focus on completing high-priority epics before starting new ones.

#### Example:
A tech startup launching a new B2B platform might create a rolling 6-month roadmap, where epics for the next two months are well-defined, while later epics remain high-level placeholders that adapt over time.

### 3. Iteration Planning: Preparing for Execution
Iteration planning (e.g., sprint planning) ensures teams know what to deliver next.

#### What it helps with:
* Converting high-level roadmap items into deliverable user stories or tasks.
* Aligning team capacity with upcoming work.
* Identifying dependencies and blockers early.

#### How we do it:
* **Refine backlog items** – Ensure user stories have clear acceptance criteria.
* **Break down complex work** – Large epics are split into achievable milestones.
* **Ensure cross-functional collaboration** – Developers, designers, and business stakeholders participate.
* **Timebox planning sessions** – Avoid over-analysis and aim for fast decision-making.

#### Example:
An e-commerce company planning a checkout experience revamp might refine backlog items into small, testable increments (e.g., redesigning the payment page, introducing Apple Pay, adding a checkout progress bar).

### 4. Risk and Dependency Management
Planning is incomplete without addressing risks and dependencies.

#### What it helps with:
* Proactively surfacing challenges before they become blockers.
* Aligning expectations with stakeholders.
* Reducing last-minute surprises.

#### How we do it:
* **Keep risk logs simple** – Focus on likelihood, impact, and mitigation plans.
* **Reframe dependencies as risks** – "X feature could be delayed if Y integration isn’t ready."
* **Review risks regularly** – Every two weeks, as part of roadmap check-ins.

#### Example:
A banking platform integrating third-party fraud detection might highlight the risk that compliance approvals could delay deployment, prompting early discussions with legal teams.

## Bringing It All Together
Planning ensures that teams have clarity, alignment, and adaptability in delivering high-impact solutions.

* **Provides a shared direction** – Aligning teams on what’s important and why.
* **Balances predictability and flexibility** – Enabling iterative and responsive delivery.
* **Prioritises value and risk management** – Helping teams focus on what matters most.

At Burendo, planning is a continuous activity, evolving as we learn and adapt. The best plans are collaborative, lightweight, and driven by outcomes, not just process.
