# Culture, Principles, Practices and Values

<!-- Our ways of working are shaped by a set of core principles, practices, and values that guide how we approach work, solve problems, and collaborate with each other. These are not just abstract ideas—they influence everything we do and help us make better decisions.

We have drawn inspiration from a wide range of movements, organisations, and individuals to define what matters most to us. While there are many influences, three stand out as fundamental to our thinking: The Agile Manifesto, Extreme Programming, and User Centred Design Principles.

These foundations help us balance flexibility with structure, ensuring we stay adaptable while maintaining high standards in everything we deliver.

## Principles 
These principles are drawn from the core influences that shape our approach. They reflect how we think about our work, make decisions, and collaborate to deliver the best outcomes.
### The Agile Manifesto values:
We embrace the core values of the Agile Manifesto, which prioritise flexibility, collaboration, and delivering real value:

* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
* **Responding to change** over following a plan.
  
These values remind us that the best results come from empowered teams working closely together, focusing on delivering working solutions, and staying adaptable to changing needs.

### The Extreme Programming values:
Extreme Programming (XP) reinforces our commitment to delivering high-quality software through collaboration, feedback, and continuous improvement:

* **Simplicity:** We will do what is needed, asked for and valuable, but no more.
* **Communication:**  We work as one team, communicating openly and frequently to find the best solutions together.
* **Feedback:**  We test and demonstrate our work early and often, listening carefully and adjusting based on what we learn.
* **Respect:** Every team member is valued, and we create an environment of mutual respect.
* **Courage:** We are honest about progress, challenges, and estimates, ensuring we build trust with our teams and customers.
  
These values help us create a culture where quality, collaboration, and continuous learning drive everything we do.

### User-Centered Design principles:
User-Centred Design (UCD) ensures we build solutions that truly work for the people who use them:
* **Users are involved in the design process from the very beginning:** Critical design decisions are evaluated based on how they work for end-users.
* **Clear alignment between business and user needs:** The team works to balance business goals with real user requirements, creating solutions that are both viable and valuable.
* **A continuous feedback loop:** We gather and analyse user feedback regularly, using it to refine and improve the product.
* **An iterative approach to design:** The user experience is always evolving. We introduce improvements incrementally, learning from real usage and adapting as we go.

By embedding these principles into our work, we ensure that our solutions are not just functional, but genuinely valuable and usable. -->
<!-- I don't think any of the above is necessary. THe below focuses on our values and experience learned on the job.  Applying what has made us successful, will make you successful.  The above is other peoples stuff, which moves us away from experience gained doing, to experience gained reading. -->

## Crafting Great Delivery
Delivery is more than just getting work over the line. It is about ensuring the right outcomes are achieved in the best possible way. At Burendo, **Customer Delivery First** means focusing on what truly matters; Solving real problems. Delivering meaningful value. Making a tangible impact for our customers.

We see delivery as a craft. It is not just about following processes but knowing how and when to apply the right tools and techniques to get the best results. The ability to adapt, make informed decisions, and navigate challenges is what sets great delivery apart.

Every engagement is different. Some give us the freedom to shape delivery from the ground up, while others require us to work within established ways of working. In all cases, we bring pragmatism, expertise, and a focus on quality, ensuring we deliver effectively while staying flexible to the needs of the situation.

By continuously refining our skills, sharing what we learn, and evolving our approach, we strengthen our ability to deliver successfully, every time.

## Principles

We follow a core set of five principles that guide how we work, solve problems, prioritise, and get things done. These principles ensure we stay focused on delivering meaningful impact while maintaining a flexible and pragmatic approach.

### 1. Deliver value early and effectively
We aim to maximise impact by delivering small, valuable increments that provide early feedback and reduce risk.

* We are agile, lean, and above all, pragmatic.
* We prioritise small, demonstrable, and deployable slices of work.
* We identify and tackle risks early.
* We minimise waste to optimise flow.
* We plan effectively while expecting plans to evolve.

### 2. Build a culture of continuous learning
We embrace change and growth, always looking for ways to improve.

* We make existing processes and ways of working visible, challenge them, and refine them.
* We encourage experimentation and learning from real-world results.
* We enable fast feedback loops to inform better decisions.
* We inspect, adapt, and continuously improve.
* We foster a safe environment where everyone has a voice.

### 3. Focus on outcomes over outputs
Success is not about delivering more—it is about delivering the right things that create real impact.

* We deeply understand our customers' business, vision, and challenges.
* We validate the impact of our work against business goals and user needs.
* We make decisions based on data, feedback, and insights.

### 4. Be open and transparent
Trust, collaboration, and honesty are the foundation of great delivery.

* We build strong, open relationships with our customers and teams.
* We are trusted advisors, influencing and guiding with integrity.
* We actively break down silos and encourage collaboration.
* We identify, communicate, and mitigate risks early.
* We are honest about challenges and failures, using them to improve.
* We celebrate success and recognise contributions.

### 5. Champion the team
A great team environment leads to great outcomes.

* We create a working environment that is effective, sustainable, and empowering.
* We promote an egoless culture where team health and happiness come first.
* We motivate, facilitate, and enable success.
* We actively remove impediments and distractions.
* We advocate for team autonomy and trust teams to make good decisions.

## Practices
Our practices shape how we work day to day. They ensure we stay adaptable, focused, and continuously improving while delivering real value.

### 1. Just Enough, Just in Time
Planning and analysis should support delivery, not slow it down. Doing more than necessary too soon creates waste and often results in rework when circumstances change. Instead, we:

* Focus on making the right decisions at the right time, not all decisions up front.
* Keep upfront analysis and design minimal—just enough to move forward effectively.
* Allow learning from delivery to shape future decisions, ensuring they are based on real-world insight.
### 2. Visualise, Understand, and Improve
To improve delivery, we first need to understand how things work today. When joining an existing engagement:

* Start by mapping out the flow of work to build a shared understanding.
* Identify key hand-offs, dependencies, and bottlenecks.
* Gather meaningful data to inform process improvements.
* Recognise that change takes time—be patient but persistent in driving improvement.
These practices ensure we remain focused, adaptive, and always improving, helping teams deliver in the most effective way possible.
