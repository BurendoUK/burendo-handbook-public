# Validate
## Introduction
Validation is the process of ensuring that we are solving the right problem in the right way before committing to full-scale implementation. It provides confidence that our understanding, assumptions, and proposed solutions are viable, desirable, and feasible.

At Burendo, we validate across four key areas:

1. **Problem Validation** – Are we addressing the right problem? Have we framed it correctly?
2. **Solution Validation** – Does our proposed approach solve the problem effectively?
3. **Feasibility Validation** – Can we realistically implement and scale this solution?
4. **Market and Organisational Validation** – Does this solution align with business objectives, user needs, and operational constraints?

Validation is an iterative process. Each step provides insights that inform the next stage, whether that means refining the design, pivoting the approach, or proceeding with confidence.

## Core Principles of Validation
### 1. **Validate Early and Often**
The earlier we validate assumptions, the lower the cost of change. We prioritise fast feedback loops to minimise risk and wasted effort.

### 2. **Use the Right Validation Method for the Context**
Not all validation needs large-scale testing. Different contexts require different approaches—from quick internal checks to full market experiments.

### 3. **Focus on Evidence, Not Opinions**
Decisions should be guided by data and real-world insights, rather than assumptions or stakeholder preferences alone.

### 4. **Consider Business, User, and Technical Feasibility**
A good solution is not just usable—it is commercially viable, technically feasible, and operationally sustainable.

## Key Validation Practices and Techniques
### 1. **Problem Validation**
Before evaluating a solution, we validate whether the problem we are solving is the right one.

#### What it helps with:
* Ensuring alignment on business goals, user needs, and strategic priorities.
* Identifying root causes rather than just symptoms.
* Avoiding wasted effort on low-value or misaligned solutions.

#### How we do it:
* **Stakeholder interviews** – Understanding the problem from multiple perspectives.
* **Process mapping & service blueprinting** – Identifying inefficiencies or gaps.
* **User research & pain point analysis** – Ensuring we solve a problem that truly matters.

#### Example:
A logistics company struggling with missed deliveries might assume the problem is driver inefficiency. However, validation may reveal the real issue is inaccurate address data, requiring a very different solution.

### 2. Solution Validation
Once we confirm we are solving the right problem, we validate whether our proposed design or approach is effective.

#### What it helps with:
* Ensuring that the service, product, technology, or organisational change meets user and business needs.
* Avoiding over-engineering by testing ideas before full commitment.
* Gaining stakeholder buy-in early.

#### How we do it:
* **Internal validation** – Using structured team critiques and design reviews.
* **Stakeholder validation** – Engaging subject matter experts and decision-makers.
* **User validation** – Testing with real users to confirm desirability and usability.

#### Example:
A healthcare provider testing a new digital appointment booking system might prototype it first with a subset of clinics before full rollout, ensuring it meets both patient and operational needs.

### 3. Feasibility Validation
Even if a solution is desirable, we must confirm that it is technically, operationally, and financially feasible.

#### What it helps with:
* Ensuring the solution can be built, scaled, and maintained within constraints.
* Avoiding late-stage technical surprises.
* Reducing implementation risks.

#### How we do it:
* **Technical prototyping** – Building proof-of-concepts to test feasibility.
* **Operational validation** – Checking whether existing teams and processes can support the solution.
* **Cost and resource analysis** – Ensuring it is financially viable to implement.

#### Example:
An e-commerce company may want to implement AI-powered search, but feasibility testing might reveal that their product data is too unstructured, requiring foundational work first.

### 4. Market and Organisational Validation
A solution must work not just for users but also within the organisation and market.

#### What it helps with:
* Ensuring the solution aligns with business strategy and market demand.
* Testing real-world adoption and commercial viability.
* Identifying organisational readiness and potential blockers.

#### How we do it:
* **Market testing (A/B tests, pilots, MVPs)** – Evaluating adoption and demand.
* **Change impact analysis** – Assessing the effects on existing processes and teams.
* **Stakeholder alignment workshops** – Ensuring internal buy-in and support.

#### Example:
A fintech startup launching a new subscription-based service might test different pricing models via an MVP before a full-scale rollout.

## Bringing It All Together
Validation is not a one-time checkpoint—it is an ongoing process that helps reduce risk, align stakeholders, and ensure that we are solving the right problem in the right way.

* **Validates the problem, not just the solution** – Ensuring we are solving the right thing.
* **Ensures solutions are feasible, desirable, and viable** – Balancing user, business, and technical considerations.
* **Uses lightweight, fast feedback loops** – Avoiding waste while gaining confidence in decisions.

At Burendo, we embed validation into everything we do, ensuring that our services, products, technologies, and organisational changes deliver real, measurable impact.
