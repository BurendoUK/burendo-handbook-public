# Account Summary Overview 
## Purpose
**The Account Summary is used by teams to:**
* Undertake an honest review of the health of their account.
* Be a handy reminder to cover all the important elements of a healthy account.
* Flag any areas of concern – so that we can mobilise help and provide support.
  
**The Account Summary is used by Account Owners to:**
* Get an honest view of how their engagements are going.
* Identify emerging risks so they can be tackled early.
* Support the team with guidance, advice, additional resources and personal intervention to make things better. 
* Drive some consistency of 'how we do things’ and 'what good looks like’ across multiple engagements.
* Share our approach and thinking with team members so that they learn and improve.
  
**The Account Summary is used by the Managing Director and the Board to:**
* Get an honest, high-level view of how our engagements are going.
* Mobilise support and act where there are serious issues.
* Spot trends that might need more company wide changes.
### How it Should Work
* Teams meet every 2 weeks to fill in the sheet.
* The sheet should be a reminder for a healthy discussion – not just a ‘stick some numbers in here’.
* The sheet should prompt the team to take action to make things better – including asking Account Owners, and their peers for support.
* Account Owners should actively help their teams to think carefully about their engagement AND help them with your direct input and advice.
* The Account Owners and the Managing Director will meet every two weeks to step through the dashboard calling out any particularly tricky areas.
* It is the Managing Director's job to mobilise advice and support for Account Owners, just as it is the Account Owners job to mobilise help and support for their teams.
* Monthly, the Managing Director will take the summary sheet and add it to a board pack and discuss the highlights and lowlights with the board – ready and armed with information about what we are doing to mitigate any challenges and information on how we are helping teams deal with challenges.
### Guiding Principles
* Account Owners are there to help the team complete the Account Summary sheet for their engagement – and in the early days, it will be more about Account Owners coaching teams through how to think about it the summary and complete it effectively, and pushing them along when they ‘don't fancy it’.
* As a start, Account Owners might pick one Delivery type person and one Specialism type person from each account and ask them to work through it with them.  Once they understand it, invite a few more people.
* The objective is to get to a point where the team do it without the Account Owner – but we’re a long way from that.
* The value is in the consistency, the reflections, the conversations and the actions taken to make things better and resolve challenges. Smashing out a quick set of numbers will only prompt the Managing Director to ask, “why is that? and what are you doing about that?”
* To get consistency between Teams and Account Owners, I’d recommend pairing up so you can share how you’d each approach it.
* Be direct but diplomatic.  Say what you mean, but don’t be harsh and don’t say anything you wouldn’t be prepared to defend in public. 
* You should be able to call out behaviours, not people,  and explain why it's a problem and how behaviour could be changed to make things better.
### Who Can See It
* Ultimately, anyone on an account should be able to see it.
* To stop a massive free for all we can limited edit permission to Account Owners and their chosen Delivery and Specialism Leads on each account.
* We should all be able to highlight activities and behaviours that don’t contribute to success – and we should be diplomatic and adult enough to be able to phrase that in a constructive way. 
* If you really want to say something that is likely to upset or offend – just tell the Managing Director.
* This isn’t about ‘reporting in’ or ‘having things on record’. It’s about a shared objective view of how we are doing and what we can do to make things better.
