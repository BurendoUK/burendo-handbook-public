# **Refinement: Preparing Work for Implementation**

## **Overview**
Refinement is the process of **breaking down epics into smaller backlog items** that are ready for implementation. It ensures work is **well-defined, prioritised, and actionable**, reducing uncertainty and enabling smooth delivery.

Refinement should be **iterative, not incremental**—teams progressively shape the backlog in response to new insights, rather than pre-defining everything upfront.

This document provides a structured approach to refinement, including **best practices for backlog preparation, slicing epics, and defining clear backlog items**.

* *[See "How to Run Effective Backlog Refinement Sessions"]*



## **Inputs and Outputs**
#### Inputs:
- Epics from the **Epic Roadmap**.  
- Unrefined backlog items (e.g. user stories, bugs, tech tasks).  

#### Outputs:
- **Backlog items ready for implementation** (well-defined, small, and prioritised).  



## **Refinement Process**
### **1. Refinement Should Be Frequent and Collaborative**
- **Recommended cadence:** **Once or twice per week** to keep a healthy backlog.  
- **The whole team should be involved**, ensuring shared understanding.  
- **Work in smaller groups** to prepare items ahead of sessions.  

* *[See "How to Facilitate Effective Refinement Workshops"]*



### **2. Iterative, Not Incremental Delivery**
#### **Incremental delivery** (NOT recommended)
- Assumes a **fully-formed idea** of the final product.  
- Breaks work into small **pre-defined chunks**, limiting feedback opportunities.  

#### * **Iterative delivery** (Recommended)
- Starts with a **rough idea**, evolving based on **continuous feedback**.  
- Focuses on **learning early and adjusting**, rather than rigidly following a fixed plan.  
- Ensures **high-value functionality is prioritised first**.  

* *[See "Iterative vs. Incremental Delivery Explained"]*



### **3. Slicing Epics into Backlog Items**
To enable **fast, high-impact delivery**, epics must be broken into **small, independently valuable** backlog items.  

#### **How to Slice an Epic Effectively**
Each backlog item should fit into one of three categories:  
1. **Essential:** The feature doesn’t make sense without this. Must be included.  
2. **Nice-to-Have:** These add value but are **not required** for functionality. Move to a lower-priority epic.  
3. **Debatable Essentials:** These are **important for success**, but **not strictly necessary** for a feature to function. Move these to a separate, lower-priority epic when possible.  

By **identifying and moving lower-priority work**, teams deliver **faster and with more flexibility**.  

* *[See "How to Slice Epics for Effective Agile Delivery"]*



### **4. Backlog Item Readiness: The INVEST Principle**
To be ready for implementation, backlog items should be **well-defined and actionable**. Use the **INVEST** model:

* **I**ndependent – Can be developed and released without dependencies.  
* **N**egotiable – Scope is flexible based on feedback.  
* **V**aluable – Delivers meaningful business or user value.  
* **E**stimable – The effort required can be roughly estimated.  
* **S**mall – Can be completed in **one iteration or less**.  
* **T**estable – Clear criteria define when it is **done**.  

* *[See "Using the INVEST Principle for Agile Backlogs"]*



### **5. Adding Detail to Backlog Items**
Each backlog item should have **just enough detail** to:  
* Avoid blockers due to missing information.  
* Allow any team member to pick it up and implement it.  
* Enable **effective collaboration** between product, design, and engineering.  

However, **avoid excessive detail** that **pre-supposes decisions** better made during implementation.

#### **Recommended Backlog Item Format**
* **Title:** Clear and action-driven (e.g. *"User can reset password"*)  
* **Summary:** Short description of what the item achieves and why.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:** Clear **pass/fail conditions** in a "Given-When-Then" format.  
* **Design References:** Link to any wireframes, mockups, or architecture docs.  
* **Technical & Test Approach:** Outline considerations, but avoid over-specification.  

* *[See "Writing Effective User Stories, Bugs, and Tech Tasks"]*



### **6. Estimating Backlog Items**
**Do we need estimates?**  
- **Epics should always be estimated** to **forecast delivery timelines**.  
- **Backlog items may not need explicit estimates** if they are small and consistent.  
- If required, use **T-shirt sizing (XS, S, M, L, XL)** or **story points (1, 2, 3, 5, 8)**.  

#### **Encouraging Small, Estimable Items**
* If an item **feels too big**, break it down further.  
* Use **technical spikes** to explore unknowns before committing to implementation.  
* **Aim for backlog items that take no more than a few days to complete**.  

* *[See "Agile Estimation: When and How to Estimate Backlog Items"]*



### **7. Prioritising the Backlog**
The **Product Owner owns the backlog**, but **prioritisation should involve the whole team**.

* Focus on delivering **high-value features** first.  
* Keep the number of active epics **low** to prevent excessive work-in-progress.  
* Use **structured prioritisation techniques** like **Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)**.  

* *[See "How to Prioritise a Backlog Effectively"]*



### **8. Buying Options: Delivering the Most Value First**
**Refinement is not just about breaking down work—it’s about making smart choices.**  

* **Focus on "just enough" functionality** before enhancing features.  
* **Deliver a complete but minimal product first**, then expand based on user feedback.  
* **Avoid over-investing in features that may not be needed**.  

* *[See "Lean Agile Delivery: Buying Options and Reducing Risk"]*

## **Key Takeaways**
* Frequent, collaborative refinement keeps the backlog healthy.
* Iterative delivery maximises learning and adaptability.
* Slicing epics properly accelerates value delivery.
* INVEST ensures backlog items are actionable and well-defined.  
* Prioritisation should focus on business value, not just effort.
* Teams should aim for small, incremental wins rather than pre-planning everything.
