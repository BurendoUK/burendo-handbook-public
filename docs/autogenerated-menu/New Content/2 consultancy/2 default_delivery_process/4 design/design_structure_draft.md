# Refined Design Structure & Content Outline

## 1. Service Design
### Introduction:
* Service design ensures that people, processes, and technology work together to deliver a seamless user experience.
* It is about end-to-end customer journeys, ensuring that all touchpoints—from digital to physical—are effective and aligned with business objectives.

### Core principles and approaches:
* **User-centred, systems thinking** – Looking at the full picture rather than isolated interactions.
* **Service blueprints** – Mapping the end-to-end service experience, including back-end operations.
* **Operational enablement** – Designing processes that allow new services to scale and operate efficiently.

### Key practices and techniques:
* **Journey mapping** – Identifying friction points in how customers interact with a service.
* **Business process mapping** – Defining how people and systems interact to deliver the service.
* **Change impact analysis** – Assessing how new services will affect internal teams and workflows.

### Wrap-up:
Service design ensures businesses are operationally ready to deliver great customer experiences.

## 2. Product Design
### Introduction:
* Product design is about shaping digital and physical products to meet user and business needs.
* It blends UX, UI, and system design to create usable, desirable, and effective solutions.

### Core principles and approaches:
* **Experience-first mindset** – Designing with the end user’s experience in mind.
* **Validation-driven design** – Prototyping and testing to reduce risk before committing to full implementation.
* **Systematic design** – Creating reusable patterns and scalable design systems.

### Key practices and techniques:
* **Wireframing & prototyping** – Designing low-fidelity to high-fidelity representations of solutions.
* **Usability testing** – Ensuring real users validate designs before committing to development.
* **Accessibility design** – Making sure solutions work for everyone.

### Wrap-up:
Product design ensures solutions are functional, desirable, and validated before development.

## 3. Technology Design
### Introduction:
* Technology design ensures that the architecture, systems, and platforms supporting a product or service are scalable, maintainable, and fit for purpose.
* It helps teams make informed decisions about the right technology to use and how it should be implemented.

### Core principles and approaches:
* **Pragmatic architecture** – Just enough design to guide delivery without over-engineering.
* **Technology selection** – Choosing tech that balances customer needs, cost, and maintainability.
* **Resilience and scalability** – Designing for reliability from day one.

### Key practices and techniques:
* **High-level architecture design** – Defining key system components and interactions.
* **Data modelling** – Ensuring structured, efficient data flows.
* **Proofs of concept (PoCs)** – Testing technical feasibility before committing to full solutions.

### Wrap-up:
Technology design ensures that solutions are not just well-designed but also technically sound and scalable.

## 4. Organisation Design

### Introduction:
* Organisation design ensures that businesses can support, scale, and sustain the services and products they deliver.
* It involves defining roles, team structures, governance, and ways of working to enable high performance.

### Core principles and approaches:
* **Adaptive structures** – Designing organisations that can evolve with changing demands.
* **Cross-functional** collaboration – Ensuring teams can work effectively across disciplines.
* **Change enablement** – Helping organisations transition to new ways of working.

### Key practices and techniques:
* **Org structure mapping** – Defining how teams and functions align.
* **Capability assessments** – Identifying gaps in skills and resources.
* **Ways of working frameworks** – Designing the methodologies that support effective delivery.

### Wrap-up:
Organisation design ensures that businesses are structured for long-term success.
