# Staffing at Burendo

## Getting the Right People in the Right Place

### The Essentials
- Staffing is the lifeblood of Burendo.
- It is a people-driven process that is challenging to get right but easy to get wrong.

## Getting it Right

### A Virtuous Cycle
When staffing is done well, it creates a positive cycle:
- **Happy Staff** → **Great Solutions** → **Happy Customers** → **Interesting Work**

### The Balancing Act
Staffing involves balancing four competing forces:
- **Short-Term Benefit**
- **Rates**
- **Skills**
- **Dates**
- **Growth**

The goal is to get the right people, with the right skills, on the right engagement, at the right time, at the right margin, supporting professional development and delivering great customer outcomes.

### The Prime Directive
- **Keep it human** – Transparency and over-communication are key.
- **No Burendoer is assigned without a conversation first.**

## The Staffing Process

### How It Works
- **Weekly Staffing Meeting:**
  - Held every Monday from 12:00 - 12:45 (Online)
  - Attended by Account Owners, Operations, Sales, Finance, and Talent Teams.

- **Key Responsibilities:**
  - **Managing Director:** Ensures alignment with the big picture.
  - **Account Owner:** Evaluates commercial feasibility.
  - **Head of Technology:** Assesses delivery feasibility.
  - **Practice Lead:** Matches roles with staff skills and career goals.

### Key Principles
- **Avoid rigid processes; prioritize grown-up conversations.**
- **Fix broken processes instead of working around them.**
- **Ensure transparency—any Burendoer can view the staffing sheet.**
- **Update the sheet frequently to keep meetings efficient.**
- **Staffing is a team effort; think about the impact on individuals.**
- **If an engagement is tough, remember to return favours.**

## Understanding Demand

### The Demand Sheet
- Tracks roles that need filling:
  - **100% Confirmed:** Needs staffing immediately.
  - **75% Certain:** Likely upcoming work.

### Adding Engagements
- Standard engagements have a **75% probability**.
- Strategic/complex engagements have a **50% probability**.
- Account Owners and Sales collaborate to propose candidates before the meeting.

### Confirming Roles
- **Unstaffed:** No available Burendoer meets the requirements.
- **Proposed:** A candidate is suggested but requires discussion.
- **Agreed:** The candidate is suitable but needs a confirmation conversation.
- **Confirmed:** The candidate has agreed to the role.

## Understanding Supply

### The Supply Sheet
- Tracks the current and next engagements of all Burendoers.
- Identifies staff approaching the **bench** (availability).
- Aims to **preemptively** line up new roles.

### Running the Session
- Identify people ending engagements within two weeks.
- Work collaboratively to place them in new roles that align with their skills and career goals.

## Handy Hints for Effective Staffing

- **One size doesn’t fit all** – Understand individual motivations.
- **Avoid mismatches** – Don’t force square pegs into round holes.
- **Give plenty of notice** – Keep staff informed about potential moves.
- **Over-communicate** – Situations change; keep staff updated.
- **Be mindful of reskilling** – It takes time and support.
- **Solo gigs can be tough** – Ensure adequate support.
- **Careers matter** – Focus on long-term development, not just job placements.
- **Remember favours** – Recognize and repay those who take on difficult engagements.

### Things to Avoid
- **Internal Poaching:** Prioritize team interests over individual placements.
- **Opinion Shopping:** Seek consensus instead of escalating disagreements.
- **Eternal Optimism:** Avoid inflating role probabilities to prevent wasted effort.
- **Part-Time Roles:** Minimize context-switching to ensure quality.

## The Bench

### Benefits
- Provides flexibility for new engagements.
- Offers Burendoers time for Learning & Development.

### Downsides
- Long bench time can be challenging for morale and finances.
- Aim to limit bench time to **one week** when possible.
- In high-bench situations:
  - **Set clear expectations with clients.**
  - **Provide upskilling support.**
  - **Rotate staff into more suitable roles as soon as possible.**
  - **Ensure every placement allows the Burendoer to add value.**

## Getting it Wrong

When staffing is handled poorly, it results in:
- **Unhappy staff**
- **Poor solutions**
- **Unhappy customers**
- **Low-quality work**
- **High turnover of staff**
