# Creating and Maintaining an Epic Roadmap

## **Overview**
An **Epic Roadmap** is a **lightweight planning tool** that helps teams visualise, prioritise, and sequence epics over time. It is **not a strict project plan**, but a **flexible forecast** that enables teams to deliver business value incrementally while responding to change.

A well-maintained epic roadmap helps teams:  
* **Align on priorities** – Ensuring the right work is tackled at the right time.  
* **Balance predictability with flexibility** – Providing **clarity without rigidity**.  
* **Manage dependencies and risks** – Making complexity **visible and actionable**.  
* **Deliver the highest value early** – Reducing the impact of overruns and maximising learning.  
* **Forecast resource needs** – Ensuring the team is appropriately sized to meet delivery expectations.  

## **Step 1: Setting Up the Epic Roadmap**

### **1. Define the Vision and Expected Outcomes**
- Work with the **Product Owner or key stakeholders** to understand **business goals and priorities**.
- **Align epics with key outcomes** rather than just listing features.
- Example: Instead of “Build authentication system,” use **“Enable seamless and secure user access.”**  

### **2. Identify and Structure Epics**
- Group epics **under themes** that align with business objectives.
- Use a **lo-fi, lightweight approach** to capture:
  - **Epic name** (clear and concise).  
  - **High-level objective** (why it exists).  
  - **Relative size estimate** (XS, S, M, L, XL).  
  - **Uncertainty level** (High, Medium, Low).  

### **3. Use a Time-Based Visual Structure**
- Organise epics into a **rolling 3-6 month roadmap** with time horizons:  
  - **Near-term (1-2 iterations)** → Well-defined, ready for execution.  
  - **Mid-term (next 3 months)** → Prioritised but still evolving.  
  - **Long-term (6+ months)** → High-level themes, subject to change.  
- Avoid mapping epics to **fixed dates too early**—focus on **sequencing rather than deadlines**.  


## **Step 2: Managing and Refining the Roadmap**  

### **1. Prioritise Epics Effectively**
- Use the **Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)** method:
  - **(Value + Time Sensitivity + Risk Reduction) / Effort Estimate**
- Focus on **delivering business value early** to maximise impact.  

### **2. Continuously Refine and Adapt**
- Review the roadmap **every 2 weeks** (or as needed).
- Adjust epic priorities based on:
  - **User feedback**
  - **Emerging risks**
  - **New dependencies**
  - **Technical learnings**
- Expect to **split, merge, or remove epics** as delivery progresses.

### **3. Breaking Down Epics for Execution**
- Epics should be **small enough to complete in 1-2 iterations**.
- If an epic is too large:
  - **Split it into independent, valuable pieces**.
  - Example:  
    - **Bad:** “Login system” (too broad).  
    - **Good:** “Log in with username and password” + “Password recovery flow” + “Log in with Google”.  

### **4. Keep the Roadmap Lightweight**
- **Use simple visual tools** (Miro, Notion, or physical boards).  
- **Avoid tracking epics in an issue tracker too early**—they often become stale.  
- **Ensure the roadmap is visible** to the entire team and stakeholders.  


## **Step 3: Managing Uncertainty and Risk**  

### **1. Expect the Cone of Uncertainty**
- Early estimates are unreliable—**plan for ambiguity** in the long term.
- Set expectations that **forecasts will change as teams learn more**.

### **2. Surface and Mitigate Risks**
- Reframe dependencies as risks:  
  - **“We depend on design completion”**  
  - **“Beta launch could be delayed if designs aren’t ready by Sprint 3”**  
- Regularly **review risks and adjust the roadmap** accordingly.  

### **3. Avoid Common Pitfalls**
**Overcommitting to fixed deadlines** – Keep forecasts **flexible**.  
**Tracking too much detail in early-stage roadmaps** – Focus on **epics and themes**.  
**Failing to update the roadmap** – Ensure **regular refinement cycles**.  



## **Do’s and Don’ts of Epic Roadmaps**  

* **Do involve stakeholders in roadmap creation** – Helps align expectations early.  
* **Don't treat the roadmap as a contract** – It's a guide, not a promise.  
* **Do prioritise high-business-value epics early** – Maximises impact if time runs out.  
* **Don't schedule vague, poorly understood epics too early** – Instead, break them into *basic vs. enhanced* versions.  
* **Do periodically reassess priorities based on user feedback and technical learning.**  
* **Don't use roadmaps for rigid feature tracking** – Roadmaps should **enable agility, not stifle it**.
