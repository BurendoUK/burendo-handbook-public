## The Early Stages: Finding and Assessing Candidates

### Demand: What, When, and How Many

We need to be **clear and consistent** about what roles we’re hiring for and why. Hiring demand at Burendo comes from two key sources:

- **Tactical (Immediate) Demand** – When customer engagements require rapid staffing.
- **Strategic (Forecast) Demand** – When we plan ahead to grow our team and expand capabilities.

The talent team needs **time to do their work effectively**. Frequent last-minute changes make it harder to find and hire the best people.

### Sourcing: How We Find Great People

We find candidates in four main ways:

1. **Direct Public Profile** – Some candidates come to us directly via our website or at industry events.
2. **Referral (Staff Introduction)** – Great people know great people. If a team member introduces someone we hire, we reward them.
3. **Talent Team (Active Searching)** – Our internal recruiters proactively look for the best talent.
4. **Agency (Chosen Partners)** – We work with a select group of recruiters who understand what we need.

No matter where a candidate comes from, they all go through the same **firm but fair** interview process. Recruitment is a **two-way street**—candidates must like us just as much as we like them.

## CV Review: The First Filter

Every CV is different, but there are a few things we always check:
- **Job Duration** – Have they changed jobs every 3–6 months? Have they stayed in one place for 10+ years? Both are worth asking about.
- **Certificates vs. Experience** – Learning is great, but we want hands-on experience too.
- **Details** – A candidate should be able to clearly explain what *they* did in previous roles, not just what their team achieved.
- **Grammar & Consistency** – Spelling mistakes and vague job descriptions can indicate a lack of attention to detail.

A great CV gives us confidence that this candidate is worth speaking to.

## The Initial Call: Getting to Know Each Other

This is our **first real interaction** with the candidate, and it’s as much about them getting to know us as it is about us getting to know them. We cover:

- **Past** – Our history, our roots, and how we got to where we are today.
- **Present** – Who we work with, what we do, and how we operate.
- **Future** – Where we’re heading and how they could be part of it.
- **Human Connection** – Do they communicate well? Do they seem like a good cultural fit?
- **Aspirations** – Does what they want align with what we can offer?

By the end of this call, we should have a sense of whether they’d be a good fit—and they should be excited about the opportunity to join us.

## Candidate Review: What We Look For

Beyond technical skills, we look for:
- **Willingness to Learn** – No one knows everything, but we value curiosity and growth.
- **Polyglot Mindset** – A broad range of knowledge is an asset.
- **Positive Attitude** – Aptitude can be taught, attitude cannot.
- **Comfort with Challenge** – We like people who embrace the unknown.

If a candidate meets these criteria, they move forward to interviews.
