# People Support

The People Team provide support for the whole of Burendo and there are two roles that are key to the support network.

## People Partner

People partners work directly with Burendoers providing support to the group by:

- Supporting the tribes through the co-creation of people products and initiatives
- Providing advice, guidance and support to all Burendoers
- Supporting the identification of Learning and Development needs and the upskilling of Burendoers
- Providing Mental Health First Aid

People partner is a full time job/role and not a hat people wear.

## People Advocate

People Advocates help one or more Burendoers facilitate their personal long term growth and help them grow their career at Burendo. They work with Burendoers on a 121 basis. We don't enforce people having a People Advocate but we highly recommend it and we look to match people that will work well together.

People Advocate is a hat people wear and we incentivise it by it helping Burendoers towards your career growth at Burendo by taking on extra responsibilities (along with the intrinsic motivation some people have for responsibilities like this).

A people advocate can support someone in any area of the business, will be peer or senior to the person they advocate, and will have capacity to support up to 8 people either in an advocate or team champion position.

### Responsibilities

The following things are examples of what a People Advocate does:

- Regular 121s with Burendoers that they advocate for
- Working with Burendoers on their career growth aspirations and personal development
- Helping to facilitate mentoring and coaching conversations and relationships within Burendo
- Help identify gaps in knowledge and push for training opportunities
- Provide support and expertise on jobs and tasks
- Raise awareness of learning opportunities within Burendo
