# The Delivery Practice

This section contains all the details on the Delivery Community of Practice(CoP), links to the tools, ways or working and processes we have created or we use.

## Practice Details

### Who we are  

We are a community of Burendoers with a common interest in delivery; whether through practical application, theory, or an interest in how delivery works with other practices within the business.

### Practice Vision

- Learning together and supporting each other
- Generating value for the wider Delivery community
- Representing burendo and the BAD toolkit in the things we do

### Practice Mission

- Support our people
- Develop our people
- Share knowledge and foster communities to develop skills
- Attract, acquire and develop talent
- Build, share and develop the BAD toolkit

### Regular Meetings  

All our meetings are captured in the practice calendar. As a Burendoer, you can join the calendar, or find links to the meetings following the bookmarked links from the [#cop-delivery](https://burendo.slack.com/archives/G01KA0CDLJW) channel on Slack.

- Weekly catch up.
  - Held every Monday at 1100.
  - Stand up style format, followed by topics of discussion for upcoming work.

- Monthly COP meetup.
  - Held on the 3rd Thursday of every month at 1500.
  - Open forum format, with space for an agenda if required
  - We all attend in person where possible


### Slack

The [#cop-delivery](https://burendo.slack.com/archives/G01KA0CDLJW) channel on Slack is our main platform for communication, outside of any face to face meetings.  This will be the place to share and get the latest information or ask questions and get the most prompt response.

### Work backlog (JIRA)  

- Our work is traditionally captured and managed in Miro.  
- Through Miro, we manage our backlog of work, as well as current work in flight.  
- We tend to work in a Kanban style, as most work is undertaken ad-hoc.  Short time boxes, such as sprints, would not suit our ability to deliver.
