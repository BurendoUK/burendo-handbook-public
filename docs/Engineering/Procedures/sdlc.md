# The Burendo Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

![SDLC](images/sdlc.png)


## What is role of the SDLC?

The SDLC presents a consistent and standardised, yet flexible framework that helps users define activities and deliverables(work).  Using this framework we can build a picture, that can be understood at all levels, of how work can be taken from inception to implementation and beyond.  Once in place and its concepts are used by all, it creates higher velocity of output, increased trust between all parties involved and more creative freedom within the bounds set by the framework.

## The four D's

We believe the four D's create the foundational concepts that underpin the SDLC.  These foundational concepts will remain consistent, even if the concepts placed over the top of them change and evolve over time.

### Core

The Core concept is the concept we do not control and why it is one of the most important concepts to understand and assess first when applying the SDLC.  
This concept is centred around the philosophy _"The client gets a vote"_.  No matter how confident you are in the application of all the other SDLC concepts, ultimately the client has a say in how they are applied.  It's very rare we will get a totally green field opportunity, and it's likely the client already has processes in place, over-arching governance or frameworks to adhere to, _(or all of the above)_. These client driven factors will influence the application, and content of the [stages](#the-six-stages) that sit on top of the foundations built by the 4 D's.  When assessing these factors we can not control, we always do this knowing that no undertaking ever goes according to plan, especially when those plans are overly complex. By having the below simple foundations to build on, that everyone, including the client can understand, means we can adjust and adapt to each clients needs, whilst being able to deliver a complete SDLC.

### Define

The _*Define*_ concept addresses factors like; 
- How do we take on work? 
- How do we apply filters to ensure we're doing the right thing at the right time?  
- How do we know we have all the information required to start?  
- What does good look like?  
- What does value look like?  
- How important is this?
- What security concerns do we need to understand?

### Design

The _*Design*_ concept addresses factors like; 
- How do we ensure we understand what we should be doing.
- What external factors will influence our design?
- Are there 3rd parties to take into consideration?
- What previous choices influence our design?
- What security concerns do we need to understand?

### Develop

The _*Develop*_ concept addresses factors like; 
- How do we create what we should? 
- What is our definition of done?
- How do we build confidence in what we have produced?
- What previous choices influence our development?
- What security concerns do we need to understand?

### Deploy

The _*Deploy*_ concept addresses factors like; 
- How do we publish what we created?
- How do we ensure longevity and improvements in what we have produced?
- How do we observe these changes?
- How do we formulate improvements?
- What security concerns do we need to understand?

## The Six Stages

Describe the six stages.  A short blurb on each stage at a high level

### Inception

### Prioritise

### Design

### Implement

### Release

### Maintain

## Cycles within cycles

The SDLC is not just a linear process.  Describe loop backs like build/test/review.

## The grey line

Some stages sit in more than one area.  Explain this reasoning.
