# The Engineering Practice

This section contains all the details on the Engineering Community of Practice(CoP), links to the tools, ways or working and processes we have created or we use.

## Practice Details

### Who we are  

We are a community of Burendoers with a common interest in engineering; whether through practical application, theory, or an interest in how engineering works with other practices within the business.

### Practice Goals  

- Develop Burendo as a recognised brand of choice for engineering consultancy.
- Become experts in our chosen areas, and display this expertise through certification, blogs, workshops, presentations etc.
- Create, apply and uphold standardised ways of working, that both benefit the business and clients alike.
- Embody our practice values of being _Open_ and _Transparent_ whilst creating _Repeatable_ and _Observable_ consumables.
- Create and champion open-source consumables, that can be used both internally, on client, and out in the open.

### Practice Values

- Open
- Transparent
- Repeatable
- Observable

### Slack

The [#cop-engineering](https://burendo.slack.com/archives/C03QE1AKHPG) channel on Slack is our main platform for communication, outside of any face to face meetings.  This will be the place to share and get the latest information or ask questions and get the most prompt response.

### Work backlog (JIRA)  

- Our work is traditionally captured and managed in JIRA tickets.  
- Through JIRA, we manage our backlog of work, as well as current work in flight.  
- We tend to work in a Kanban style, as most work is undertaken ad-hoc.  Short time boxes, such as sprints, would not suit our ability to deliver.
