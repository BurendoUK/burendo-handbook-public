#  Recently Asked Questions

When interesting or pertinent questions are asked in one of your regular forums, it's important we attempt to capture those questions and the response given.  We can use this to help others in the future, create a basis for a blog or podcast, drive our values or just create a consistent reference for those asking questions.

### I have joined a team that does not communicate well, follow agreed ways of working, and is currently underperforming.  What can I do as a Burendo Engineer?  

> Lead. Even if you are not in a traditional leadership position within the team.  As Burendo Engineers, we are brought in for more than just our technical ability.  We are considered consultants, because we bring more to the teams we are on and the businesses we are employed by than a single dimension experience.  This makes us leaders, no matter what our role is within the team.  We should have enough understanding of what it takes to be a part of a high performing team, to influence any aspect that we feel is missing, even if that means picking up tasks that do not constitute being part of our role within the team.  For example;  
> If you see that your team is lacking discipline in their code review process, ensure your code review submissions are always how you would like to see the rest of the team submit theirs.  
> If you notice work tickets do not have have enough detail in, or are not broken down enough, ensure that your tickets are well thought through and are small enough to fit the teams daily cadence.  Perhaps arrange regular 3 Amigo sessions if they are missing, or a breakdown session (in order to further reduce ticket sizes), after planning.  
> If your team are not communicating well enough about work they are doing, or work they have done, be the one who sets a standard of communication.  Openly ask for your tickets to be reviewed and your outcomes assessed before moving tickets into done.  

> It is important that rather than question why they are not doing something, instead explain why you _are_ doing something. This is often more difficult in blended teams, whether with another partner or even with client staff.  Either way we should not shy away from bringing the standards we set ourselves, to every team we join.

> What we are doing here is instead of complaining, we are leading.  We're setting the standard, and using the outcomes of our work to show how it can be done. Yes, there may be times when we need to escalate issues, but it should not be our first reaction. We should not worry about stepping beyond what others may consider to be client expectations, these are _our_ expectations.  Our goal is to deliver the best experience for the client, and if we encourage and develop better engineers a long the way, all the better.
