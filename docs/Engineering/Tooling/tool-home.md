# Tooling Home

### API Documentation

Use this space if we are going to use tools to provide API documentation to both internal and external users of our services.

### Automated Testing

We use the following tooling to automatically and manually test code. (this list can be changed as just an example)

* **Artillery** is used to fire requests at a service and ensure that it can handle customer load.
* **BackstopJS** for ensuring that webpages do not visually regress.
* **BrowserStack** is used to test against a wide range of browsers and devices.
* **Cypress** is used to run headless Chrome-based end-to-end tests on frontend repositories.
* **Jest** is used to take snapshots of visual components and to run unit tests.
* **Lighthouse** for ensuring that web pages meet accessibility, performance and SEO standards.
* **Nightwatch** is used for end-to-end testing journeys.
* **Mocha** is used to write unit, feature, integration and end-to-end tests.
* **Postman** is used to locally test APIs and share those tests among developers.

### Coding Standards

We use the following tools to ensure developers adhere to coding standards across projects.

* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for ensuring code quality across our team.
* [Prowler](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler) for ensuring compliance of architectural standards within AWS.
