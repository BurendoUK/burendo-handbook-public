# burendo-handbook-public
This repository contains all the public content for the Burendo Handbook.


## Adding content

In `docs` there are a number of subfolders. This structure will represent the side menu on the handbook. 

When you add new content, consider the structure and the menu and ensure you add new folders if necessary and put your new documents in a relevant folder.

**Do not put new content in to the root of the project or the root of `docs`, ensure they go in to one of the subfolders**

When you have made any changes, ensure you create a Pull Request on GitHub with all your changes in and get the PR approved by the Engineering community.
