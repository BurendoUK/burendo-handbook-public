# Stepping into Engineering

In this blog I will talk about how I, as a Scrum Master/ADL took the opportunity to learn some hands on, front-end engineering work such as HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

## A bit about me

I am very much a Scrum Master/Agile Delivery Lead by trade and a very non-technical one at that. I’ve never really dipped my toes into the world of engineering languages until now and I will share my discoveries throughout this blog. The reason I wanted to learn more about engineering is so I can become more effective in my role so having a good base knowledge of the space and the practicality of it, I believe will help. I also aspire to become a more well-rounded consultant capable of offering a wider range of disciplines. I believe that by continuing my development, I can achieve this goal. 

## The starting point

I have been very fortunate to spend quite a bit of time pair programming alongside one of our other Senior Consultant Engineers (Brian) which was where we began to look at some HTML. We decided that to keep it fun and engaging, we would approach this doing a topic that we both share and enjoy…. Golf! We decided that we would build a golf scorecard from scratch using HTML, JavaScript, and some CSS…no cheating, just manual coding!

As part of this, Brian sent me a list of things that he thought would be useful to look up before our initial meeting where we would get our hands mucky. This list included things like links to W3Schools on HTML forms and how to build a table in HTML, a link to CodePen so I could code and see the result instantly and finally a recommendation of downloading Visual Studio Code where we would actually, write the ‘proper’ code. I then watched a YouTube tutorial for VS Code. When writing the code for the actual score card, I had learnt that we needed to identify the document type and then used some of the tags I had learned from W3Schools such as `<form>` and `<table>`.

## Building the Scorecard

We spent around 6-8 hours in that first week talking through the building of the code, HTML first for the primary structure of the Scorecard page, then we used JavaScript for some functionality such as the sum of player 1, integrating handicaps etc and finally we used CSS to make this scorecard look like a scorecard rather than a white page with lines and numbers. We also added in some cool features to the score cells so that it showed a red colour If it was birdie or better, white for a par and a black box for a bogey or worse helping to bring the card to life that little bit more. This involved a lot of me asking Brian why, why do we do this, why do we do that? After the introduction of a new piece of learning, I would go then go away and try and figure out the next section on my own, sometimes running into small problems such as spelling errors or missing semi-colons which effected functionality, these were all key learning points for me. To some, these things may seem basic and obvious, but to me it highlighted just how accurate you need to be when writing code. 

In engineering we all know how important it is to test the code we have written. Our next step was to test this in a html google view on my machine to guarantee that the scorecard was looking as it should be. We ensured that when we put numbers in the different boxes, we were getting the correct outcomes, such as red for a score under par and the sum in the in/out and total rows. It was great for me to see this come to life! 

## How I found Stepping into Engineering

First of all, it is important to highlight just how fortunate I am to be in a position to be able to learn something like this. Having another, experienced consultant available as well as the whole engineering practice has been a massive help, especially when doing solo learning aside from the pair-programming. That being said, I have enjoyed learning some of the technical side of my role and would recommend any non-technical SM’s/PO’s/ADL’s etc to take a step into the technical side and understand more of life as an engineer. 

## What’s next?

As part of my continuous learning and genuine interest in the front-end development, I have recently started an online Udemy course in the basics of JavaScript that also touches on some (very) basics of HTML. I also did some 1 to 1 coaching with one of our Heads of Delivery, Ian, around CI/CD and have been pointed in the direction of a few things such as Trunk Based Development, source control, unit tests and many other modern software engineering practices. This gives me a very good starter for my continued journey into the whole world of engineering and will enhance my understanding and technical abilities when on client which is a win/win for everyone! As I move forward, my next action involves creating a pull request on GitHub as I finalise the composition of this blog.
