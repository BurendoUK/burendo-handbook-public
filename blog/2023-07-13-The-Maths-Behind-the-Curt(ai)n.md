# The maths behind the curt(ai)n

## Introduction

Ever wondered how computers can learn and make smart decisions? Well, it's all thanks to maths! In this blog I'll explore the maths used in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to solve problems and create amazing products, relating some key mathematical techniques to the most familiar AI use cases. The maths at play may seem to be the domain of the developers who actually build the solutions, but for product owners, business analysts, UI/UX and indeed users, it’s really important to understand how the maths influences and limits what AI products can really do.

### Chicken or egg?

There’s no such conundrum here :slight_smile: The Mathematics used in ML and AI predates and underpins the modern technological advances. The concepts and principles of mathematics have long been studied and developed by brilliant minds throughout history. From ancient civilisations to the modern era, mathematicians have laid the groundwork for all the algorithms, models, and techniques used in AI and machine learning today. 

## In practice

### Finding patterns

Finding patterns is an essential task in data science, and mathematics techniques, such as linear algebra, play a crucial role in this process. Linear algebra helps us analyse and identify patterns in various types of data, including pictures. For instance, computers can use linear algebra techniques to recognise faces in photos by detecting patterns in the arrangement of pixels.

In addition to image recognition, linear regression is another widely used technique in data science to identify relationships between different data items and make predictions. It enables data scientists to explore how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another. By fitting a line that best represents the relationship between the variables, linear regression provides insights into the patterns and correlations within the data. This technique is commonly employed in various domains, such as finance, marketing, and social sciences, where understanding relationships and making predictions based on observed data are of great importance.

### Making good decisions

Making good decisions is a crucial aspect of machine learning, and calculus, a branch of mathematics, plays a key role in enabling algorithms to make optimal choices. In machine learning, calculus helps algorithms figure out the best options by optimising and finding the most favourable solutions.

For example, self-driving cars rely on calculus to navigate the road and determine the best path to take. Just as we would find the fastest way to reach a destination by considering factors like distance, traffic, and speed limits, self-driving cars use calculus to analyse variables such as the car's current position, the surrounding environment, and real-time traffic data. By applying calculus-based optimisation techniques, self-driving cars can calculate the optimal route to reach their destination efficiently and safely.

### Dealing with guesses

Dealing with guesses is an important aspect of artificial intelligence (AI), and probability and statistics play a critical role in helping computers make educated guesses. These mathematical concepts enable systems to estimate the likelihood of different outcomes based on past data and observations. This knowledge is particularly crucial in AI because it allows systems to quantify uncertainty and make informed decisions based on probabilities.

In the context of language generation, large language models (LLMs) like GPT rely on probability and statistical techniques. These models estimate the likelihood of different word sequences or grammatical structures occurring based on patterns they've learned from analysing vast amounts of data. By assessing the probabilities of different options, LLMs can make "best guesses" about the most suitable words to generate next in a given context. This probabilistic approach ensures that the generated text is coherent, contextually relevant, and aligns with the patterns observed in the training data.

### Creating stories or making new music: 

Creating stories or making new music involves leveraging mathematics techniques, such as Markov chains, in generative AI. Markov chains are mathematical models that help generate sequences of events based on probabilities. In the context of generative AI, Markov chains are utilised to create branching stories or compose new music.

When it comes to creating branching stories, the computer uses Markov chains to analyse the probabilities of different story paths based on user choices. The Markov chain model considers the current state of the story and the available choices, assigning probabilities to each possible next step. By using these probabilities, the computer can dynamically determine what happens next in the story, leading to a unique narrative experience for each user.

## Why maths matters beyond the developers:

For everyone involved in developing an AI product, understanding maths is crucial for the following reasons:

Ensuring Quality Outputs: Understanding the maths behind AI allows you to assess the reliability and accuracy of the results generated by AI models. This knowledge empowers you to identify limitations, improve the quality of AI products, and ensure reliable outputs for users.

Making Informed Decisions: Probability theory helps quantify and manage uncertainty in AI systems. By grasping probability, you can evaluate the confidence levels associated with AI predictions and make informed decisions based on the likelihood of different outcomes.

Enhancing User Experience: Understanding the mathematical techniques used in AI enables you to critically analyse and interpret results, identify biases or inconsistencies, and improve the fairness and inclusiveness of AI systems. This ensures a better user experience and avoids potential issues.
Driving Business Value: Maths is essential for driving business value through AI. Understanding the maths behind AI algorithms and models helps align AI capabilities with business objectives, identify suitable applications, and make informed decisions on resource allocation and investment in AI technologies.

## Conclusion:

Understanding the maths behind AI is vital for delivering high-quality outputs, making informed decisions, enhancing user experiences, and driving business value. Maths equips you with the tools to assess the reliability of AI models, evaluate uncertainty and probability, ensure fairness and inclusiveness, and maximise the potential of AI technologies. By embracing the mathematical foundations of AI, you can steer your organisation towards success in the AI-driven landscape while delivering impactful and valuable AI products.
