# The Myth of the Scrum Master: A Tech Lead's Perspective on Why We Don't Need 'Em

## Introduction
Ah, the Scrum Master... Shepherd of agile teams, keeper of ceremonies, the majestic servant leader. 

If you've been in the software engineering field for a while, you've undoubtedly heard about/come across/worked with someone in this role. But let me tell you a little secret: In all my time as a tech lead, and not once have I felt the need for a Scrum Master. Intrigued? Buckle up, because we're diving into this hot topic.

## What is Scrum?

First things first, let's talk Scrum. It's a framework that's part of the agile methodology, aimed at delivering high-quality software. The Scrum Master is the facilitator, the one who ensures that the team follows the Scrum rules and rituals. Sounds important, right? Well...

As someone who's been in the trenches, the Scrum Master can often seems like an extra in a cast of players.

### Task Delegation
Engineers are more than capable of picking up tasks and running with them, right? We don't need a Scrum Master to hold a ceremonial staff and delegate who does what. We've got GitHub, Jira, and good ol' common sense for that. A study by VersionOne found that 14% of agile practitioners saw no value in the role of a Scrum Master. That's not a majority, but it's not a negligible number either[^1^].

But let's not forget that a Scrum Master can act as a buffer between the team and external distractions, making room for engineers to focus on delivery. They can also help the Product Owner in prioritising tasks based on business value, something engineers might not always have full visibility into. A Scrum Alliance report suggests that Scrum Masters can improve team productivity by up to 40%[^2^].

### Meetings, Meetings, and More Meetings
Ah, the dreaded meetings. Daily stand-ups, sprint planning, sprint reviews—you name it. The Scrum Master often leads these, but let's be honest: how many times have you found yourself thinking, "This could've been an email"? A survey by Atlassian showed that 47% of employees consider meetings to be the number one time-waster at work[^3^].

However, while meetings can be tedious, a skilled Scrum Master can make them efficient and focused. A Scrum Master facilitates the event to ensure it stays on point and is efficient. They ensure that everyone's voice is heard and that the team aligns on goals and blockers. They can also adapt the meeting formats to suit the team's needs, making them less of a time-waster and more of a time-investor.

### Team Autonomy
Teams can self-organise. We don't need a Scrum Master to tell us how to collaborate or resolve conflicts. We're adults; we can't we figure it out? A paper published in the Journal of Systems and Software found that team autonomy positively correlates with software quality[^4^].

_Mature_ teams can self-organise, but what about new or less experienced teams? A Scrum Master can act as a coach, helping teams to become self-sufficient. They can also provide a neutral perspective in conflicts, something that's hard to achieve when you're in the thick of it. A Scrum Masters ultimate goal is to no longer be needed, this is achieved when a team matures to a state where they are autonomous and are constantly performing.

## But Wait, There's More!
Now, I can already hear "what about facilitation skills?" you ask. Sure, facilitation is important, but it's not rocket science. Most experienced engineers have been through enough projects to know how to keep a meeting on track, and if not a single engineer with that experience can often lift a team out of the mud.
And then there's the "coaching" argument. Yes, coaching can be valuable, but it doesn't have to come from a Scrum Master. In fact, peer coaching among engineers can be just as effective, if not more so. A study in the International Journal of Human-Computer Studies found that peer coaching led to significant improvements in software quality[^5^].

Facilitation is more than just keeping a meeting on track; it's about ensuring that the team is aligned, focused, and continuously improving. A Scrum Master brings a set of skills and techniques that can help facilitate more effective discussions and decision-making.
While peer coaching is valuable, a Scrum Master can provide a broader perspective, helping the team to see the bigger picture. They can also facilitate coaching sessions, ensuring that they are structured and effective.

There is a fundamental difference between Facilitation and Coaching as well as peer coaching. A scrum master facilitates events as you state, but a scrum master can also coach the team in proper facilitation techniques so they can learn how to facilitate their own events (part of a maturing team) Peer coaching is encouraged by scrum masters ( unless I am mistaken is this not peer programming?) Your message above conflates facilitation with coaching which are different things. Each have their own skill set and a good scrum master can encourage the strengths within the team to be shared.

## The ScrumBan Twist: A Hybrid We Can Get Behind?
Just when you thought we were done dissecting the world of agile, let me throw a curveball your way: ScrumBan. No, it's not a new brand of deodorant or a forbidden dance move. It's a hybrid of Scrum and Kanban, and it's got some folks in the software community buzzing.

So, what's the deal with ScrumBan? Imagine taking the structure of Scrum—sprints, roles, ceremonies—and mixing it with the flow-based approach of Kanban. You get a more flexible framework that allows you to adapt to changes more quickly. It's like the mullet of agile methodologies: business in the front, party in the back.

### Why ScrumBan Makes Sense (Sorta)
Now, I know what you're thinking: "Didn't you just spend the last few paragraphs bashing Scrum?" Well, yes, but hear me out. ScrumBan takes some of the rigidity out of Scrum and replaces it with Kanban's focus on continuous improvement and flow. It's like Scrum went to a yoga retreat and came back all limber and chill.

In ScrumBan, you still have sprints, but they're not as rigid. You can pull in new tasks as you complete old ones, just like in Kanban. This is a godsend for teams that have to deal with a lot of unplanned work. A study published in the Journal of Software: Practice and Experience found that ScrumBan can significantly improve lead time and reduce the number of blocked items[^6^].

### But Don't Get Too Excited
While ScrumBan sounds like the best of both worlds, it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. If your team is already self-organising and delivering like a well-oiled machine, adding ScrumBan into the mix might just complicate things. Remember, the best process is the one that helps your team deliver value, not the one that has the coolest name or the most buzzwords.

## Real Talk: Case Studies
Let's get down to brass tacks. I've been on projects where we delivered high-quality software, on time, without a Scrum Master. And guess what? We're not alone. Spotify, a company known for its engineering culture, has famously eschewed the traditional Scrum Master role in favour of a more flexible agile approach[^7^].

While some companies like Spotify have found success without a traditional Scrum Master, others have thrived with one. Companies like Salesforce and IBM have reported increased team productivity and morale with the inclusion of a Scrum Master[^8^].

## Wrapping It Up
So, do we really need Scrum Masters? Teams can—and do—function perfectly well without them. That's not to say they don't have a place in the software engineering world; they do.  I should also caveat that the first Scrum Master experience I had, was my best.  He did everything he could to hand over as much autonomy to my team as possible, he advised from a distance, never tried to take a technical stance on anything and did an amazing job protecting the team from outside influences when required.  All of what he did, had a massive impact on how I lead a team, and of course has allowed me to take this stance today. Ironically, he was a Business Analyst by trade.
It's also worth noting that not all Scrum Masters are created equal. A good Scrum Master adapts to the needs of the team, providing value where it's needed most, whether that's in facilitation, coaching, or shielding the team from distractions. So, while some teams may function well without one, others could benefit greatly from a skilled Scrum Master.
