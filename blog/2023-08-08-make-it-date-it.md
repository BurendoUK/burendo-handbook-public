# Estimating. If you don't make it - you don't date it.

How long is a piece of string? The age-old way of explaining that no one knows the answer. Take for example measuring the coast line from Blackhead to Looe, depending about how you go about measuring something will change the result. If you use a ruler you will get about 42cm, if you use a piece of string and trace the coast line and then measure that you get about 47cm. However, if you break out a map measuring wheel (Yes it does exist and is a real thing) you end up with 65cm!!!

Each measuring device used zoom ins on the coast line looking at it in greater detail. Each new cove and inlet increases the length of the coast line and the closer you zoom in, the longer that length will become. In fact, the more you zoom in the closer to infinite that length will become.

In maths, you have the concept of estimating, it is not used to get an exact answer but estimating something will give you a boundary to work within. So if you go to the supermarket and you buy 5 chocolates at £0.95 each, you know right off the bat that if it comes to more than £5 or less than £3, there is a problem.

So here is Rachel. It is late in the evening and chocolates are needed. So Rachel calls her wonderful other half, Ross, that she wants 5 chocolates. Ross heartily agrees and starts to arrange for the delivery of said chocolates. Ross however, has never really used money before and is not entirely sure how much the chocolates cost. What he does know is that you need money to get the chocolates from the supermarket.

Ross bumps into Chandler in the hall way and asks how much and how long will it take to buy some chocolates. Chandler says about £2 and about 10 mins but check with Joey!! Ross shouts back to Rachel and says it will be 10 mins! Ross goes to Joey, gives him £2, and says get me chocolates. Now Joey being the food lover that he is, is eager to help out. Joey asks how many chocolates do you want and when do you want it. Ross diligently relays his promise of 5 Chocolates in 10 mins!

To cut a long analogy short, after 10 mins of Joey explaining to Ross that A, there is not enough money for 5 chocolates, and B, it’s late at night and you have to drive across town to get said chocolates and therefore will not be delivered on time. Now Joey is annoyed, Ross is angry, and Rachel still does not have her chocolate!!

There are two points I am trying to make here and I am fairly certain every Scrum Master feels this pain. The first is estimating correctly. If you are estimating using a ruler or in the Agile world, I would relate this to a Project Manager or business sponsor (or using the second example - Ross!) estimating when a project will be delivered. **This never ever, ever, never ever works!!!**

If the ask is estimated with a piece of string, chances are you have spoken to Chandler or the Product Owner. A rough estimate based on the information available!

Now if you estimate using a map measuring wheel, you are speaking to Joey. Joey is the guy that does the work and works with people who know how long the car journey will be, what supermarket to get the chocolates from and effectively, how much it will cost.

Having a piece of work estimated by someone who will physically not do the work is effectively doomed to deliver out of time and out of scope.

This is the biggest issue, in my experience, businesses have when transforming into an Agile framework. It is probably the easiest and the most difficult to overcome. The business wants a date and if they get that date, they are emotionally attached to that date. When emotions are in play, it all gets messy pretty quickly.

Estimating is a team sport. Having the different skill sets involved in the estimation will give you a much better estimation. Make no mistake; estimating is hard if you have never done it before. But as with any team, sport accuracy comes with practice. You do not need to zoom that far into the weeds that you are estimating every individual task, that’s counterproductive. As you practice the art of estimating, you will estimate at the exact level required, not too high level and not down in the weeds.

Here are some tips that can help getting started with estimating:

1. **Have the right people estimating!**

2. **Everyone in the team needs to be involved.** Focusing on a few individuals to do the estimating will make the others feel left out and feel like they are not contributing to the team.

3. **Time box estimating stories.** Decide upfront how long you will spend deciding and estimating. My rule is no more than 4 mins per story. The longer you spend, the more you zoom in on details and the estimation starts getting out of whack. A well-refined story should be estimable in a short space of time. If it cannot be agreed, park it and set another session up to refine it further.

4. **Keep the discussion at the right level**, stay out of the weeds.

5. **Estimate on what you know.** If there are assumptions - resolve those first and come back to it.

You need everyone who will work on the ask to provide their input and when the whole team starts estimating stories and tasks, these estimations can be taken back to your sprints, matched with your teams velocity. You can then give a realistic pessimistic and optimistic date range, that can be comfortable and shared with the requester with a high degree of confidence.

When your scrum team are estimating the work and agreeing to do that work in the team, your team will have a vision, a vested interest and shared understanding of the work.

**If you don't make it! Don't date it!**
